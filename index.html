		<h2>Week 1</h2>
        <h3>Week One: Getting Started with Simple Styling</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Introduction to CSS3! In this course you will learn how to style your pages by taking advantage of the power of CSS3. We will focus on both proper syntax (how to write your styling rules) and the importance of accessibility design (making sure that your style enhances your site, not make it harder to navigate). It is so important that you jump in ready to make mistakes and typos in this course. The only way you will really understand the material is to practice typing it in on your own as often as possible.</p>

		  <h3>Week 1-01. Introduction to the Course</h3>
		  <p>Welcome to Introduction to CSS3. In the next four weeks, we're going to learn how to take plain simple HTML5 code and turn it into something really beautiful.</p>
		  <p>What will be doing over the next four weeks? Well, the main focus will be on learning about cascading style sheets. We're going to talk about why they are a better way to style than what people used to use in the early 2000's and late 1990's. 
          Next, you're going to learn the syntax. Once you know that it's a better way to use it, how can we make sure that you're writing really good code? Once you've figured out the syntax, we'll go on and we'll also talk about development tools.
          When you do web design, it's very rare that you just sit there and you code, and you don't look to the left, or look to the right, or go look on the web. Instead, you're going to be using other tools to see how you can change your code without actually having to write the code beforehand. 
          Finally, as always, we'll be talking about accessibility issues. It's always fun to add colors and animations and cool things to our page. When we do that, we want to make sure that we don't do it at the cost of accessibility. We want make sure everyone can see everything on our page.</p>
          <p>So, let's talk about what we're going to do on each of the four weeks. In week one, the focus is really on just getting you started, getting your feet wet and getting you a little bit of confidence in knowing that you can do this. 
          We're going to start by talking about the three common methods for styling code. And once we cover them, we're going to talk about how these methods interact, which ones are better in different situations. And different things that you can feel confident knowing how you can best style your page in any specific situation. 
          Next, we'll talk about the basic styling of fonts. By the end of week one, I really want you to be able to take a web page and change something really obvious. Can you change the text so that it's cursive, or underline, or a different color? Finally, we'll very briefly talk about placing elements on the page. This is going to be an important element of our entire four weeks. Is trying to figure out how you can put your header over here or an image over there. And it can be tricky but that's okay. Because we're going to repeat it week after week.</p>

<h3>Week Two: Advanced Styling</h3>
<p>Colors and fonts are just the start to styling your page. The nice thing about starting with these properties is that they are usually very straightforward to implement. You pick a color and boom - instant, expected results. This week we move on to new properties that tend to require a little bit of tweaking to get the desired results. In particular we will talk about the Box Model, background images, opacity, float, columns, visibility, and designing for different browsers.</p>

<h3>Week Three: Pseudo-classes, Pseudo-elements, Transitions, and Positioning</h3>
<p>Have you ever noticed on a web page that some links are blue and others are purple, depending upon if you have clicked on the links? How is it possible to style some anchor tags and not others? This week you will learn how to style pseudo-classes (e.g., a link that has been visiting, an element that has the mouse hovering over it) and pseudo-elements (e.g., the first-letter of a heading, the first line of a paragraph). These elements are not difficult to style, but do require careful coding. It is also the first step to adding simple animation to your site. We end this week with the subject of positioning -- how to get elements to stick to a certain part of your page. Think about annoying pop-up ads. How do the programmers get them to stay RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN despite the fact that you keep trying to scroll them away.</p>

<h3>Week Four: Putting It All Together</h3>
<p>This week I am going to do some code review. I will show you how I used pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements to style a table. Then I give you a demonstration of three different navigation bars that utilize different styling options. We will want to step back and talk about how these different options may affect the accessibility of our site. The final step to completing this course is the completion of the peer-graded project. You will have the chance to demonstrate the ability to follow styling guidelines while still putting your own personal touch on the project. Just remember, you need to validate your work for proper syntax and accessibility.

<h2 id="week-1">Week 1</h2>

<h2>Week One: Getting Started with Simple Styling</h2>

<p>Welcome to Introduction to CSS3! In this course you will learn how to
style your pages by taking advantage of the power of CSS3. We will focus
on both proper syntax (how to write your styling rules) and the
importance of accessibility design (making sure that your style enhances
your site, not make it harder to navigate). It is so important that you
jump in ready to make mistakes and typos in this course. The only way
you will really understand the material is to practice typing it in on
your own as often as possible.</p>

<h2>Week Two: Advanced Styling</h2>

<p>Colors and fonts are just the start to styling your page. The nice
thing about starting with these properties is that they are usually very
straightforward to implement. You pick a color and boom - instant,
expected results. This week we move on to new properties that tend to
require a little bit of tweaking to get the desired results. In
particular we will talk about the Box Model, background images, opacity,
float, columns, visibility, and designing for different browsers.</p>

<h2>Week Three: Pseudo-classes, Pseudo-elements, Transitions, and Positioning</h2>

<p>Have you ever noticed on a web page that some links are blue and
others are purple, depending upon if you have clicked on the links? How
is it possible to style some anchor tags and not others? This week you
will learn how to style pseudo-classes (e.g., a link that has been
visiting, an element that has the mouse hovering over it) and
pseudo-elements (e.g., the first-letter of a heading, the first line of
a paragraph). These elements are not difficult to style, but do require
careful coding. It is also the first step to adding simple animation to
your site. We end this week with the subject of positioning -- how to
get elements to stick to a certain part of your page. Think about
annoying pop-up ads. How do the programmers get them to stay RIGHT IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN despite the fact that you keep trying to scroll
them away.</p>

<h2 id="week-4">Week 4</h2>

<h2>Week Four: Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>This week I am going to do some code review. I will show you how I
used pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements to style a table. Then I give
you a demonstration of three different navigation bars that utilize
different styling options. We will want to step back and talk about how
these different options may affect the accessibility of our site. The
final step to completing this course is the completion of the
peer-graded project. You will have the chance to demonstrate the ability
to follow styling guidelines while still putting your own personal touch
on the project. Just remember, you need to validate your work for proper
syntax and accessibility.</p>

<h3>Where To Go from Here?</h3>

<p>If you would like to do more now that you have finished this course,
I have a few recommendations. The most important thing is that you
continue to practice your skills and always have "something" that you
are working on.</p>

<h2 id="syllabus">i. Syllabus</h2>

<h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>

<p>Welcome to Introduction to CSS3. CSS stands for Cascading Style
Sheets, a method of styling your HTML documents with various colors,
fonts, layouts, and spacing. But that is just the beginning. You can
also do some "cool" stuff such as creating transitions or adding
animations. There are so many things you can do with CSS, that we focus
on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rules and syntax (how to write CSS code)</li>
  <li>Simple styling (fonts, colors, borders)</li>
  <li>More styling (background images and opacity)</li>
  <li>Positioning - how to get the different parts of your page to go where 
    you want them to go</li>
  <li>Pseudo-classes - styling things that aren't even there!</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the entire course there will be an emphasis on the
importance of accessibility. Not only will you style your site, but you
will test it and other sites on the POUR accessibility principles to
ensure that your styling is enhancing your site, not putting up unseen
roadblocks.</p>

<h2>How this course works:</h2>

<p>This course assumes that you already know how to write HTML code and
are ready to style your pages. In each module you will be asked to do
the following:</p>

<h2>Read module lectures</h2>

<p>The information has been broken down into pieces to help you learn
the material in the smallest chunks that still give you enough
information to do something with it. The goal is to give you the ability
to listen to these during any time you have. You will find that some of
the videos have material that makes sense to you at once. Sometimes you
may want to replay other videos to clarify the material.</p>

<h2>Code with module lectures</h2>

<p>Some of the videos are not traditional lectures, instead they are
videos where I demonstrate the concepts from an earlier lecture. I
highly recommend that you code along with me while you watch these
videos. <em><b><u>The key to success in this course is in writing
code.</u></b></em> I put these videos in so that you have something
specific to practice. It is also a great way for you to see how often I
mess up when I am coding!!</p>

<h2>Read extra materials</h2>

<p>Each module will include reading material. It is impossible to learn
everything you need to learn just by listening to the lectures. There
are suggested readings to go along with this course. I also encourage
you to seek out other resources online. Anyone who wants to work with
technology needs to understand that it is important to update your
skills.</p>

<h2>Quizzes</h2>

<p>The first three modules will each have a graded quiz. These quizzes
are intended to reinforce your confidence in the material, not "trick"
you. As often as possible each question will be linked to a specific
lecture or reading. You can take the quizzes as many times as you like,
but there is a limit on how many times you can take each quiz in a
certain time period. Occasionally I include an ungraded quiz to help
students track their current progress and prepare them for the graded
quiz.</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>There will also be material provided in many of the modules.
These may range from links to recent articles to videos on pioneers in
the fields of design and accessibility. None of these materials will be
required for the quizzes, but rather provide additional ways for you to
branch out and learn more about the history of the field or the emerging
ideas.</p>

<h2>Communication</h2>

<p>Communication for this course is done via the Discussion boards. The
best way to utilize the discussion board is to search for your topic
before posting. If you can't find an answer, please try to post your
question to the appropriate week. The mentors and Course liaison do a
great job of helping people. And, of course we rely on students to help
each other as well. If you want to contact me directly, I do check my
Colleen@UMSI Twitter account. I cannot respond to emails.</p>

<h2>Participation Strategies</h2>

<p>Engaged learning looks different for everybody. In this course, we
hope you will define your own measures of success and engage with the
material in a way that best suits your needs. We recognize and celebrate
the diverse ways learners engage in courses. As you go through this
course, we hope you will reflect on your unique skills, needs, and
aspirations, and engage in the course material in a way that aligns with
your own goals. While the course provides time estimates for completion,
you should feel empowered to engage in the material in whatever ways
make sense to you.</p>

<h2>Ground Rules</h2>

<p>We expect everyone to be mindful of what they say and its potential
impact on others. The goal is to have respectful discussions that do not
violate the community space created for these conversations. Here are
some productive ways to engage in this course: </p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Participate:</b> This is a community. Read what others have 
    written and share your thoughts.</li>
  <li><b>Stay curious:</b> Learn from experts and each other by listening 
    and asking questions, not making assumptions.</li>
  <li><b>Keep your passion positive:</b> When replying to a discussion 
    forum post, respond with thoughts on what was said, not about the person who 
	posted. Avoid using all caps, too many exclamation points, or aggressive language.</li>
</ul>

<p>We expect all learners to abide by our full <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Ucy-lT33FmkDDYdtxHEJ_nRytVLr_XGRVq2moAsPB4/edit">Learner
Engagement Policy</a>. We will specifically be monitoring this course
for language that could be considered inflammatory, incivil, racist, or
otherwise unacceptable for this learning space, and we will remove
language deemed such.</p>
<p><em>Please note that external study groups on applications like
WhatsApp are not affiliated or endorsed by the University of Michigan.
We strongly discourage joining external groups and instead recommend
interacting with your fellow learners within the platform.</em></p>
<p><em>Please express caution if you do join or post any personal
information in these forums or in these groups. These forums are
publicly accessible and any information you post may be collected,
published, or used in an exploitative manner (scams, etc).</em></p>

<h2>Academic Honesty</h2>

<p>All submitted work should be your own and academic dishonesty is not
allowed. Academic dishonesty can be defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copying answers</li>
  <li>Copying words, ideas, or other materials from another source without giving 
    credit to the original author</li>
  <li>Copying from your peers within the course</li>
  <li>Employing or allowing another person to alter or revise your work, and then 
    submitting the work as your own</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Support</h2>

<p>Questions and discussion of course material should take place within the course 
itself. Please do not contact instructors or teaching assistants off the platform, 
as responding to individual questions is virtually impossible. We encourage you 
to direct your questions to [forum], where your question might be answered by a 
fellow learner or one of our course team members. For technical help please contact 
the <a href="https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener

<h2>Accessibility </h2>

<p>We are committed to developing accessible learning experiences for the widest 
possible audience. We recognize that learners with disabilities (including but 
not limited to visual impairments, hearing impairments, cognitive disabilities, 
or motor disabilities) might need more specific accessibility-related support to 
achieve learning goals in this course.</p>

<p>Please use the <a href="https://forms.gle/sxxDQvstDYJF9PtR6"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accessibility feedback form</a> to let 
us know about any accessibility challenges such as urgent issues that keep you 
from making progress in the course (e.g., missing or inadequate alt-text, captioning 
errors).</p>

<h2>Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice</h2>

<p><b>We welcome all learners to this course.</b> People like
you are joining from all over the world and we value this diversity. We
strive to create a community of mutual respect and trust, where people
from all backgrounds, identities and views are valued and heard without
the threat of bias, harassment, intimidation, or discrimination. We pay
attention to your feedback, how different types of learners experience
this course, and aim to make improvements so the course can best serve
everyone. We hope you enjoy learning about topics that are important to
you.</p>

<img class="border displayed"

  style="width:40%" />

<p>Hello, everybody. Welcome to Introduction to CSS3. In the next four
weeks, we're going to learn how to take plain simple HTML5 code and turn
it into something really beautiful.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 04. what this course will cover (08) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image004.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="What This Course Will Cover." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What will be doing over the next four weeks? Well, the main focus will be on 
learning about cascading style sheets. We're going to talk about why they are a 
better way to style than what people used to use in the early 2000's and late 1990's.</p>
<p>Next, you're going to learn the syntax. Once you know that it's a better way 
to use it, how can we make sure that you're writing really good code? Once you've 
figured out the syntax, we'll go on and we'll also talk about development tools.</p>
<p>When you do web design, it's very rare that you just sit there and you code, 
and you don't look to the left, or look to the right, or go look on the web. Instead, 
you're going to be using other tools to see how you can change your code without 
actually having to write the code beforehand.</p>
<p>Finally, as always, we'll be talking about accessibility issues. It's
always fun to add colors and animations and cool things to our page.
When we do that, we want to make sure that we don't do it at the cost of
accessibility. We want make sure everyone can see everything on our
page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 05. week one (08) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image005.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Week One: Getting your feet wet." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's talk about what we're going to do on each of the four weeks. In
week one, the focus is really on just getting you started, getting your
feet wet and getting you a little bit of confidence in knowing that you
can do this.</p>
<p>We're going to start by talking about the three common methods for
styling code. And once we cover them, we're going to talk about how
these methods interact, which ones are better in different situations.
And different things that you can feel confident knowing how you can
best style your page in any specific situation.</p>
<p>Next, we'll talk about the basic styling of fonts. By the end of week
one, I really want you to be able to take a web page and change
something really obvious. Can you change the text so that it's cursive,
or underline, or a different color? Finally, we'll very briefly talk
about placing elements on the page. This is going to be an important
element of our entire four weeks. Is trying to figure out how you can
put your header over here or an image over there. And it can be tricky
but that's okay. Because we're going to repeat it week after week.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 06. week two (09) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image006.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Week Two: Box Model, Styling Links &amp; Lists, Adv Selectors &amp; Browser Capabilities." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>In week two, we will discuss the box model. This is a very common
concept for any web developer, because we talk about how every element
on your page is actually a box.</p>
<p>Next, we'll talk about styling links and lists. We all love the links
in our page. The web is the web because we have links, so how can we
make them look really cool? Next, we'll talk about advanced selectors.
In the beginning of the course, we'll be very careful about styling
simple elements such as styling a list or styling a paragraph or styling
a header.</p>
<p>Next, we're going to want to talk about what if we only want to style
some of the links, not all of the links?</p>
<p>Finally, we'll talk about browser capabilities. Just like when you
learned about HTML5, you learned that some browsers support some tags
while others don't. In the same way, browsers treat CSS differently. And
I want you to know how to best react to that.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 07. week three (10) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image007.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Week Three: Pseudo Classes and Elements, Transitions, Transforms, &amp; Positioning." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>In week three, we talk about pseudo classes and elements. These are
this cool idea of how we can make different things happen when we hover
over a page. It also talks about how we can style just certain things
like the last paragraph in the page or the first paragraph.</p>
<p>We'll also talk about transitions. This is a way of changing the look
of one of the elements on your page, which is very similar to the idea
of transforms.</p>
<p>Transforms are how we can rotate things on the page, skew them,
making them bigger and smaller, and doing different things like
that.</p>
<p>Finally, again we'll talk about positioning, how we can make things
go in a certain spot and stay there all the time. We've all seen really
annoying pop-up menus and different pop-up ads. Now you can make your
own annoying pop-up ad.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 08. week four (10) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image008.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Week Four: Styling a Table &amp; Styling a Navigation Menu." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>In week four, we're not really going to cover new material. Instead,
it's going to be samples, samples, and more examples and samples. In
particular, I want to show you different ways that we can style a table
and different ways for styling a navigation menu.</p>
<p>The bulk of week four will really be spent working on your final
project. I want you to know right off who this class is for and if
you're ready and are interested in taking it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 09. who is this class for? (11) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image009.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Who is this class for?"
  style="width:40%" />

<p>First of all, you don't want to take this class unless you know about
HTML5 already. You may be taking a course on it. You may be just going
online and reading about it, but you need to feel comfortable if I
mention things such as tags or elements or validation.</p>
<p>Next, this class is for people who have persistence. You will never
code your pages the right way the first time. Even the second time,
sometimes the third, fourth, and fifth time. It's really about enjoying
the whole process of really wanting to get something to work and feeling
little victories when it does happen.</p>
<p>Finally, this class is for those who are willing to do more than what
I'm going to do in these lectures. There's only so much information I
can give to you. It's up to you to practice it, tweak it, change it, and
try to really see what happens beyond what I'm showing you.</p>
<p>If you want to know a little bit more about me and why I'm choosing
to teach this class, here's a little bit of background information. I
have a PhD in Computer Science. But to be honest, that's really the
least important part. What I really have is two decades of teaching
experience. And during this time, I've taught a wide range of students
and a wide range of topics. And I found that I really enjoy explaining
things in different ways, and I really enjoy reaching out to students
who maybe have more questions. My emphasis on education has always been
running around the classroom, helping students debug, meeting with them
one on one.</p>
<p>Let's talk about how you can succeed in this course. In a perfect
world, you get together with friends, you'd code together, you'd learn
from each other’s' mistakes, and you'd also learn from each other’s'
successes. While we don't have that one-on-one experience, make sure you
use the message boards. Not only to ask questions but to see what other
questions people are putting. You can learn a lot that way. I really
can't stress enough that I don't want you to feel like I'm trying to
trick you, or that I'm giving some sort of gotcha problems. If you're
ever working on something and you're stuck on it for more than 15
minutes, move on. This is CSS, it's styling. There's always something
you can change, and you can find something else that you prefer to work
on.</p>
<p>Make sure that you're looking things up on your own. There's no way
I'll be able to teach you everything you need to know. And, that's why
you can go on the Internet and look at different resources, and see if
there's something out there that you would like to recreate.</p>
<p>Finally, it's really important that you practice this as much as you
can. If you do the minimum required for this course, and you're happy
with that, that's great. I'm glad that you're able to learn something.
But if you really want to be a web developer, it's so important that
you're enjoying what you're doing, and you're going off on your own, and
you're creating something beautiful whenever you can. I welcome you to
the class, and I can't wait for you to join us as we learn more about
cascading style sheets. Thanks.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<h3>Software:</h3>

<p>The <b>preferred</b> way to code in this class is editor software (Notepad++, 
TextWrangler, Sublime, etc.). If you do not have the ability to access or install 
this type of software, there is an online editor at:
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_intro" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_intro</a>
.</p>

<p>You can also use CodePen (there is a link below). It is important that you find 
a way that you can enter code and still test your work.</p>

<h3><b>Code:</b></h3>

<p>All of the code I cover is available from a CodePen repository. I hope you can 
play with the code to test the different concepts we will cover. Here is a link to 
the CodePen repository for the Week One code. <a href="http://codepen.io/collection/noEQed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://codepen.io/collection/noEQed/</a></p>

<p>Here is a list of the lectures this week that use CodePen, and the name of each 
file that they use:</p>

<h3>Building Your First Web Page by Shay Howe</h3>

<p>This tutorial can be found at <a
href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/">https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/</a>.</p>
<p>This is a great resource for a lot of my students. I particularly like
that the author uses CodePen. This is a great feature that lets you
open, edit, and run the code as you learn about it. The lesson "Building
Your First Page" gives a brief overview of HTML and the structure of
pages. I am going to assume you already know about that, but it is a
good refresher. The second part of this reading explains many of the key
terms that I will be using throughout this course.</p>
<p>You might find it easier to read through this after going through the
lectures. Or better yet, read this first, watch the lectures, and then
review the material again, but this time play with the code to see if
you can change the pages.</p>

<p>Welcome to our first truly technical lecture in our CSS course. It's about adding 
style to your pages. If you've come to this course with me from our HTML course, 
you know that I know that you can make general HTML files. But up until now, you 
may not have styled them at all.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img class="border displayed"

  loading="lazy"
  alt="The 'Cascading' Part of CSS."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What I want you to know before we even begin styling, and you start
putting your own little twists on the pages, is that the same HTML file
may look different when viewed on different browsers, and there's a few
reasons for that.</p>
<p>First, some tags aren't supported in some browsers while they are in
others. If you've ever used the details tag, you can see that sometimes
your page will have little arrows or different little markings on them
and other times it won't. That comes down to tags that are supported.
But also, every single browser has its own different default style. And
what that default style says is this is how I want my H1 headings to
look, or this is how much padding I want around my paragraphs. If you go
to the exact same page on different browsers, it may be hard to tell,
but you'll see tiny little differences in how things are made. But in
general, this default look is really plain. And most people I know, they
don't want their pages to look plain. They want to put in some style.
Let's begin looking at ways you can do this. One way to add style is to
think about adding it directly into the text.</p>
<p>Now as HTML evolved, we went from having tags that were distinctly
about color, and about different centering, and things like that. To
saying no, no, we don't want tags that have to do with style. We only
want tags that have to do with content. People said, okay, we can do
that, but I want to make it pretty.</p>
<p>How they did this is they added style attributes. In this case, I've
taken an h1 tag and added the style attribute and simply said
<b><mark>"color:blue"</mark>.</b> And what this is going to do
is it's going to make this particular h1 heading have blue font to it.
It's very simple. It's a nice way to just go in and add simple styling
to your page. However, this still kind of breaks our rule of wanting to
separate content from style. Because if you want to change it to, say,
red or green or something like that later, you're going to have to go in
and change the tag, because you're going to have to change the
attribute. I really tried to go out of my way to not use this at all,
and instead, get in the habit of doing things the right way. And the
right way to style your pages is to use CSS.</p>
<p>Cascading style sheets are basically a way for you to write rules
that say how you want to style all the paragraphs, or how you want to
style all your headings, or how you want to style some of your images.
It's a really nice, specific way that everyone can follow to make these
styling choices. And the rules are set up like this.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 12. cascading style sheet: selector (15) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image012.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Cascade Style Sheet: Selector."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>First you have to put up your selector, and selector is just kind of
a fancy way of saying what it is you want to style. In our case, we'll
start off by just giving the selector different tag names such as h1 or
paragraph. Once you find which tag it is you want to style, you say
which property it is you want to change. We can look at things such as
color, background color, how much space we put around it, we're going to
cover all of those.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 13. cascading style sheet: selector, #2 (16) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image013.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Cascade Style Sheet: Selector, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>But for right now, we're going to start off really simple and deal
with colors. Then, you have to give each property a value, saying which
color you want it to be. On one side, we have the very generic, how we
write a rule. And on the other, I've written a very specific rule that
says, hey, whenever you see an h1 heading, I want you to make the font
color blue. We've done exactly what we did when we embedded using the
style tag, but now it's very generic, and we're not talking about a
specific heading. We're not talking about a specific tag.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 14. cascading style sheet: selector, #3 (16) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image014.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Cascade Style Sheet: Selector, #3."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When you write those rules, the syntax is very important. A lot of
times, when you write HTML, the browser is really nice to you and if you
forget to close a tag it says, that's okay, I know what she wants me to
do and it'll go ahead and put the page up anyway. When you're doing CSS,
if you're sloppy with what we call your syntax, you're going to get in
trouble. The brackets and the semicolons are very important. Let me show
you again when we go back here, you can see that I've got a beginning
bracket and a closing bracket, and I've got this semicolon right at the
end. You need to remember to include those.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 15. rule syntax (17) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image015.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Rule Syntax."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And one of the reasons I talk about this is that when you start
writing your code, when you pick a good editor, and most editors are
pretty good, such as Sublime or TextWrangler, TextEdit, Notepad++, they
will put colors in for you. So, all of a sudden if you're looking at
your CSS rules and you're like, woah, I kind of expected things to be
different colors, but instead everything's white or everything's red. It
gives you this hint that you've messed up on your rule syntax. In the
same line, I want to put comments in to help you debug and explain to
yourself what you're doing. This is how comments are done in CSS. You
just do the /*, */ again.</p>
<p>What happens if you want to do more than just one property? What if
instead of saying just you want the color to be blue, you also want the
background color to be yellow? Well, no problem. You can have as many
property value combinations as you want. You just need to remember to
separate them with semicolons.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 16. multiple properties (17) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image016.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Multiple Properties; color and background-color." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>In this case, again, I've set the color to blue and the background
color to yellow.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 17. internal style sheet, #1 (18) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image017.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Internal Style Sheet, #1."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>All right so now that you know how to write a rule how do we actually
get them to work? There's two ways and the first way I'm going to tell
you about is called using an Internal Style Sheet. As you can see over
here in my code, I've got the basic template of our file. And inside the
head tags, I've put this style tag in, that's where you're going to want
to put your rules, they're defined right within that style.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 18. internal style sheet, #2 (18) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image018.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Internal Style Sheet, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Inside the style tag, I've added the h1, the color blue, and I've
ended my style tag. What happens now is that when the browser opens your
page, it gets to the head section it says, oh great, she wrote some
rules, let's see what she wants me to do. And it's going to know to go
through your page and apply this rule to all the H1 tags. And if you
have multiple rules including paragraphs, images, things like that, it's
going to know, I want to apply this to all instances in the entire
file.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 19. internal style sheet, #3 (19) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image019.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Internal Style Sheet, #3."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>There is a really good chance you're going to mess up because I do
this 80% of the time when I'm developing in class, and what I do is I
forget to close this style tag. And if you forget to close that style
tag down at the bottom, well actually your page may end up being blank.
So don't freak out when you first start doing this if your page is
blank, it probably means you forgot to close the style tag. All
right.</p>
<p>Internal style sheets are really nice when you're just trying to
style up one page. All right? And I often do it just so I can keep all
my code in one file instead of going back and forth and back and forth.
Imagine that you have site where you're going to have 10, 20, 1,000
different pages and you want them all to have a very consistent look
about them. You don't want to have to go in and say if you want to
change a color, you don't want to have to go in and open every single
one of those files so you can change the color to red or green.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 20. external style sheet, #1 (19) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image020.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="External Style Sheet, #1."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Instead, what you want to use is you want to use something called external style 
sheets. The way it works with an external style sheet is that you put your rules 
in a different file. You open up a file, you're going to save it something such 
as like my style with a .css file extension. Now the browser knows, oh everything 
in HTML, that's the content. Everything in .css, that's the layout. When you make 
your external style sheet, it looks just like we just did in the internal, except 
for you don't use a style tag. Then, once you've put your rules in a separate file, 
all you need to do is add a link into the head section. In this case, I've gone in, 
I've put my link, I need to let it know the relationship because of the style sheet. 
And you have to remember to put the file name. Once again this is where it's going 
to be really important that you're naming things in ways that they make since to 
you. You can link to as many different style sheets as you want, most of the time 
we start with one.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 21. external style sheet, #2 (20) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image021.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="External Style Sheet, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Now that we've had that style sheet, every single file that links to it will 
all share that style sheet. Remember when I mentioned that you might have a site 
with 10, 20, 1,000 pages to it and you decide to change that color from blue to 
red or green or something like that? This is great. All you need to do is open 
up style.css, change one line of code, and you've now just changed potentially 
thousands of pages.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 22. the 'cascading' part of css, again (20) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image022.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="The 'Cascading' part of CSS, again."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's talk for a second about this idea of cascading style sheets. What does 
it mean that we're cascading? Well, when the browser goes to make your page, the 
first thing it's going to look at is go, all right, maybe they're not telling me 
anything. How do I normally make h1 headings? How big do I make that font? Have 
its own kind of default values. But then it goes and it looks and it says, oh are 
there any external style sheets. Because if so, I'm going to overwrite my browser
defaults and put in the rules that are in this external style sheet instead.</p>
<p>Next, it's going to check for internal style. That style you have in the head 
section. Because in general, the browser thinks, maybe there's something really 
special about this particular page, and here she wants me to do these rules instead.</p>
<p>Finally, any of those inline styles where you use the attribute tag, those are 
going to have the highest precedence of all. It can be really confusing, because 
you might start writing up different rules, and you can't figure out why some are 
working and some aren't. This is where the cascading part comes in again. First 
it looks at defaults, then external, then internal, and then inline. Which is why 
really you want to avoid using any inline style because it pretty much nullifies 
all your styling rules.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 23. rule precedence, #1 (21) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image023.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Rule Precedence, #1."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Alright, so we know how those four go, but what if you have a selector and, 
you've linked to two or three different style sheets, and that same H1 has been 
defined to be blue, green, and yellow, but in different files. How does the browser 
know what to do?</p>
<p>Well, how it works is that the rules from the most recent file have precedence. 
And what I mean by the most recent file, it means it goes up into the head section 
and it goes one, two, three, and it kind of looks at what order you listed them, 
and the last one you listed is the one that's going to have precedence.</p>
<p>Okay? Well, what if you have a selector in the same file, and you've written 
H1 multiple times. This can actually happen quite a bit. Especially if you decide 
to go off and be part of a big development company, you write some code, and then 
someone else writes some code, or, as I tell my undergrads, maybe you went out 
and had a really good time one night, and you came home and decided, I'm going 
to code! And you forget that you've already written some rules. Well, if that's 
the case, once again, the browser's going to look at the one it saw last.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 24. rule precedence, #2 (22) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image024.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Rule Precedence, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>In this case, I have two rules for h1. One writes at the color to
blue. And I said, hey I want you to use this aerial font family. And
then later, there might be a whole bunch of stuff in here, might be
nothing, and I say hey, I want you to use a font family Times. How the
browser's going to look at this is it's going to go down, and say, I'm
going to make all the font blue, and I'm going to go ahead and make the
font family Times. It's just always is going to use the last one it
saw.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 25. rule precedence, #3 (22) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image025.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Rule Precedence, #3."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Again, the most recent rule has precedence, whether it was inside
your code or it came from different files.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 26. !important (22) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image026.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="!important."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>There is, however, one way to overwrite this. Suppose you're writing
something and you know you want something to be that way. You don't care
if anyone else overwrites it. You really want to make sure people aren't
using inline style, different things like that. What you can use is you
can use the <b><mark>!important</mark></b> Attribute right
here. Right here I've got font-family, Arial, and I've got important
right here. Even though later I decide to overwrite it with times, the
browser's going to say nope, I know that she really wanted me to use
Arial, and it works out.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 27. styled heading (23) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image027.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Styled Heading."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's go ahead and look at an example of what I mean by all those
precedents. I know just listening to me can get a little overwhelming,
so I've got a quick example showing you the different ways and then I'll
kind of wrap up this lecture.</p>
<p>Let's start off using the style attribute. As you can see in here,
I've written the code, and I've used the style attribute for this h1
heading, and this one paragraph. In this case, I want my h1 heading to
be blue, and my paragraph to be red. And what I really want to show you
is that the only paragraph that was changed to red text or red font was
the first one. The other one's still black. The only way to style is if
you go in and you change each and every tag to make it look the way you
want it to. If I wanted all the paragraphs to be red, I'd have to go in
there and put style equals, style equals. In this example there's only
two, but you can imagine how it'd get really annoying if you had a lot,
okay.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 28. internal styled heading (23) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image028.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Internal Styled Heading."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>In our next example we have an internal style. In this case, I've put
in my style tag up at the top and I've added rules for paragraphs and H1
headings, and it should handle both. Now there's nothing in here
anymore, my tag is all by itself. And if you look at the result, let's
go over here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 29. internal styled heading, #2 (24) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image029.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Internal Styled Heading, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>You can see that now, even though my HTML doesn't have any type of
styling in at all, both of the paragraphs are red over here and so's the
heading. All right?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 30. external styled heading (24) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image030.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="External Styled Heading."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The last example I had for you is, I took these exact same rules and
I put them off into an external style sheet. Again, there's no style tag
here. It's just the rules themselves. And then I had to go back to the
HTML file, and you can see right up here, near the top, I have hey,
let's link to the style sheet I want. Now, I want to point this out very
carefully to you.</p>
<p>If you notice, I have css/externalStyle sheet. This means that my
style sheet is in a special folder called css. Developers really stress
that you do this, because you want your code to be kind of organized
into different parts. Again, in the same way, I now have a page that
uses external style sheets and looks really good. All this code is going
to be available for you to look at it, but I want you to kind of play
with it as much as you can.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 31. external styled heading, #2 (25) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image031.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="External Styled Heading, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>But I want to use this final example to help you understand how the
cascading works. Right here, I have my external style sheet. I'm going
to go over here for just a second. Go to my, and I'm going to add,</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 32. external styled heading, #3 (25) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image032.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="External Styled Heading, #3."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>One last thing. Sorry, this is going to be awkward. And I'm going to
say you know what? Instead, I want that font to be black again, and I
end it. I'm going to show you what happens when you mess up really
quickly. I'm going to save it; I'm going to reload my page and
everything disappeared. This was what I was talking about. You really
want to make sure you include that style tag. Do it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 33. external styled heading, #4 (25) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image033.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="External Styled Heading, #4."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Make sure you close it up. All right. Now what I have going on here
is my browser has its browser default. It has an external style sheet,
and now it also has an internal one. Let's see what color it's going to
be, if it's going to be blue or if it's going to be black. And as you
can see, it's black. As you start styling, it's going to be very
important that you look at different ways for separating your content
from your formatting. As well as looking at the different ways that you
can do that formatting.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 34. review (1.02) (26) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image034.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="1.02. Review." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>One of the first things I want you to think about is how this idea of
external and internal style sheets really plays into the separation of
content from formatting. And at the same time, I want you to understand
that we don't always follow every rule. In the beginning we always have
to start with really simple examples to help you solidify what's going
on with CSS. I'm just going to end this now with a brief demo from an
example they have at csszengarden.com because I think it really brings
home the idea that CSS can be very powerful. Let's take a look.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 35. css zen garden, #1 (26) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image035.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="CSS Zen Garden, #1."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>At this site, CSS Zen Garden, they've actually done a really great
job of showing all the different ways you can format an exact same file
but in different ways.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 36. css zen garden, #2 (27) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image036.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="CSS Zen Garden, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Up here, if you take a look, you can see that this is one person's
style sheet for decorating or styling this document. Now, without
changing any of the HTML at all, someone else came in and said, hey, you
know what, that's nice, but I'm going to style it this way.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 36. css zen garden, #3 (27) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image037.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="CSS Zen Garden, #3."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>It looks completely different. It's the same exact HTML but it looks
completely different.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 38. css zen garden, #4 (27) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image038.webp"

  style="width:40%" />

<p>In the same way, we've got this one right here, same exact HTML. But
you couldn't look any different, because they've added some CSS and
JavaScript to it that's different. Come on with me. We're going to code
a lot in this course. We're going to be playing a lot with this course.
You're going to be messing up a lot in this course. But I can't wait for
you to develop something that really reflects how you want your page to
look. Thanks.</p>

<img class="border displayed"

  style="width:40%" />

<p>Hi. In today's lecture, we're going to be talking about colors.
Before I really jump in, though, I just want to remind you that I'm a
computer scientist, and art and design are not necessarily my core
background. In fact, I'm pretty bad at it. So, what I'm going to be
talking to you about today when I'm talking about colors is the best way
to code up colors. Instead, when you're really looking for advice on
what the best color schemes are going to be. I'm going to direct you to
different places online and let you use your own expertise to kind of
figure out what goes best with each other. But let's begin with how we
use colors on your web page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 40. color conventions (28) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image040.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Color Conventions."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>We talk about the three different basic color conventions, the main
ones that people use. Conventions is just another word for suggestions.
It's not a rule. You don't have to follow the rules I'm going to give
you. It's just the way that most programmers program so that they can
understand what you're trying to do, when they look at your code. One
way that you can add color is to just simply use the English word. Blue,
red, yellow, etc. These work, and they'll show up fine on your page. The
problem is, is that it's not consistent across the pages. What's yellow
to one browser is not the exact same shade of yellow to another
browser.</p>
<p>In general, we avoid color names when your final project is coming
up. When you're just coding and hacking away, you just want to pop
something up on the screen. No problem. Use blue or red or yellow but
then later what you're going to want to do. It changed when these other
two conventions I'm going to talk about.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 41. color conventions, #2 (29) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"

  loading="lazy"
  alt="Color Conventions, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The first one is called hexadecimal. Hexadecimal you might recognize
the decimal part, that's how we count from zero to nine. Hexadecimal
just means they have sixteen digits instead of ten. You can use zero to
nine, but then also A, B, C, D, E, and F. And F is kind of like the
strongest, most powerful number you can use.</p>
<p>When you do hexadecimal, it's always set up the same, where you have
a pound sign followed by either three or six digits. The examples I have
here for you are six digits. And the way it works is that you have a
red, green, and blue value, and the bigger the number you put in there,
the more red, green, or blue you'll see.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 42. color conventions, #3 (29) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image042.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Color Conventions, #3."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Here's my example. I have an example of blue, red, but also yellow
because depending on how much of these different values you put in, it's
can change the color that's going to show up on your screen.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 43. color conventions, #4 (30) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image043.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Color Conventions, #4."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Now hexadecimal is probably the most common way of doing colors when
you look at a lot of people's pages, but another way that's coming up a
lot is the RGB. Again, it's the same idea that we have red, green, and
blue, but instead of using these kinds of strange hexadecimal numbers,
the zero to F, instead you're using numbers between zero and one. Here
I've done the same thing, I've just done one, one, and one, one. I could
have just as easily put 0.5, 0.8, 0.6, and that would change the
strength of the color.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 44. color conventions, #5 (30) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image044.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Color Conventions, #5."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Here I have rgb (0,0,1). One of the reasons that people have been
switching over to rgb is that there's another option called rgba.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 45. color conventions, #6 (31) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image045.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Color Conventions, #6."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And for the longest time I really had to think about what that a
meant and what it stands for is alpha transparency. You have a fourth
value on the end that says, you know what? I want to use this blue
color, but I want to kind of make it a little bit see through.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 46. color conventions, #7 (31) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image046.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Color Conventions, #7."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When it comes up, if I were to actually make it zero it would be
completely see-through. If I were to give it a final value of one, it
would look just like the regular rgb value. Different monitors can
display colors in different ways. I want to show you an example of how
you can see some of these different colors and how they're working.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 47. course webpage (32) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"

  loading="lazy"
  alt="Course Webpage."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What I brought up here is my course webpage and it's okay if you
can't see it. I know it's kind of small. What I want to show you is me
using something called Inspect Element to really look at my page, and
look at the colors, and a quick way for me to see how I can make it look
different.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 48. inspect element, course webpage (32) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image048.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Inspect Element, Course Webpage."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>I have my mouse, right here. I'm going to right-click, and I’m going
to go down to Inspect Element. Now for some of you, this part may pop
over to the side or underneath.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 49. inspect element, course webpage, #2 (32) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image049.webp"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Inspect Element, Course Webpage, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>You can move it around by clicking on this button over here. But as
you can see, I'm going to highlight my h1 and go down here to the
span.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 50. inspect element, course webpage, #3 (33) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image050.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Inspect Element, Course Webpage, #3."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And you can be like oh, there's the color I'm using.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 51. inspect element, course webpage, #4 (33) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image051.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Inspect Element, Course Webpage, #4."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>I'm going to click on this, and as you can see I can actually in real
time, play with which different colors I want. I like that one better
than the blue and you can see that it is changing the hexadecimal value
for me down there. If I wanted to, I could find the perfect color, this
green is not the perfect color. I could find the perfect color, grab
that hexadecimal value and put into my style sheet.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 52. inspect element, course webpage, #5 (33) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image052.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Inspect Element, Course Webpage, #5."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>They also give you the option of the RGBA value as well so you can do
it either way you want. I love using expect element to play with the
colors because it's so much easier when you can see what's happening as
you're designing it.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 53. inspect element, course webpage, #6 (34) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image053.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Inspect Element, Course Webpage, #6."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>If you want to check something else, I can even go down here, each
thing as you highlight you can add colors, do different things along the
same line. I wouldn't suggest this, but I'm going to add a background
color.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 54. inspect element, course webpage, #7 (34) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image054.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Inspect Element, Course Webpage, #7."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And as you can see, they have the actual names. Because it's very
unlikely that if you were to scroll through the different hexadecimal
values you have any idea what it's talking about. And instead of
actually using the word beige, once again I can click on that box. It'll
pop up the hexadecimal value for me. This is where it can get really fun
and really bad, because you can just start falling down this rabbit
hole. And you're like, oh I like this color. No, this color's better.
You're beginning, you're starting off, just pick a color, play with it,
and keep going with it. But let's go back.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 55. accessibility (35) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image055.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Accessibility." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>One of the things that happens when people are using color is there's
this really natural tendency to want to use color to emphasize
something, or explain how important something is. You may have seen when
you filled out forms that it says make sure to fill out everything
that's in red. Well, this can be a real problem when it comes to
accessibility. And I want you to make sure that you're trying to think
about the most appropriate way to use your color when you're designing
your page.</p>
<p>And one of the things you need to think about is that it's not enough
to think, someone can use the screen reader. I'm going to use HTML tags
to really make sure that they can pick up the semantics from the page.
No, there are a lot of people reviewing your site who aren't legally
blind. Instead, they're visually impaired or they're just color blind.
They're, many more people are color blind than you would ever really
get. You want to make sure that when you're using your page, you're
thinking about whether the colors are conveying meaning or just
style.</p>
<p>Think about your color contrast and what color contrast it that when
you look at a page is the text on a good color for the background? Most
of us intuitively know when something has really poor color contrast.
We're squinting at it. But to be honest, very few of us know what the
really exact level is of where you need to go.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 56. what is color contrast? (36) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image056.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="What is Color Contrast?" 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What you can do is use different tools to help you quantify the
contrast between text and its background color. I've put in two links
here. The wave.waveaim.org, and the Wave contrast checker. And I'm going
to show you just a quick example of how you can use these to check a
page. I go over here, and I've got the wave.webbing.org. And you can
type in any URL. I'm going to go ahead and put in my own personal web
page from UMISH, which may change by the time this comes up.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 57. detect contrast issues, #1 (36) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image057.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Detect Contrast Issues, #1." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And, as you can see, you can go over here and it'll check your
styles, it'll check your different HTML.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 58. detect contrast issues, #2 (37) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image058.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Detect Contrast Issues, #2." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>But if you check where my mouse is, you can also check on the
contrast. And it'll go in and it'll say, nope, this looks good. There
were no color contrast issues detected. You'll be surprised how much,
though, you will get examples. They can be extremely picky and if it's
really something that you feel strongly that you can see, absolutely,
stick with it. But you want to take their suggestions with a grain of
salt.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 59. don't use color alone to convey meaning (37) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image059.webp" 
  alt="Don't Use Color Alone to Convey Meaning."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The one thing I really wanted to talk to you about again, is just
this whole idea of don’t use color alone to convey meaning. This is a
typical bar graph for people to use colors to say, hey this is how much
share is Apple iPhone, the Pre Palm, different things along that
line.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

<img class="border displayed"

  loading="lazy"
  alt="Test in Gray Scale."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's look at that same graph but in grayscale. And suddenly you can
see it's pretty much useless to anybody who's really trying to pick out
these parts in the middle where the colors are extremely similar.
Instead, if you're going to use a graph like this, I'm not saying you
can't, I'm saying make sure you're providing alternatives. Make sure
you've got alternate text or you've got a caption or someplace else
where people can link to get this information.</p>

<img class="border displayed"

  loading="lazy"
  alt="1.03. Review - Color."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>All right, I know I didn't talk a lot about the different colors that
you can use, or the different colors that go together, again, because
that's not really something I need to lecture you about. It's something
that you can go off on your own and learn. What I did want you to
understand is how those different color conventions work. How that you
know you can use hexadecimal or RGB, RGBA, or even the words themselves,
but you want to get away from that.</p>
<p>Finally, when you're done, when you've got your colors going, don't
get too attached to them. Because you're going to be surprised at how
often, when you check your site using a contrast checker, that what you
thought looks really great really isn't something that's accessible to
everybody. Have fun with the colors. Use inspect element. Everyone loves
to play with these different design elements of your page. And I hope
that you've learned something here that's useful as you continue
programming, and keep styling your site.</p>

<h2 id="week1-04">1.04. Styling Your Text</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 62. styling your text (1.04) (39) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image062.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="1.04. Styling Your Text."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Hi, in today's lecture, we're going to talk about styling your text
on your webpages. One of the best and easiest ways to really make your
page look a little bit different than the standard default is to think
about how you might want to style your text to bring maximum impact. So
many options and we're going to talk about some of them today.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 63. options (39) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image063.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Options." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>One of those options is to think about basically your font. Some of
the things you can style are the font family, the font style, the font
variant and the font size. We can also think about styling the color and
background of your font. We can talk about alignment as well. And
finally, we're going to talk very briefly about line-height.</p>
<p>These are all four things that you can do to highlight or emphasize
the different things you would like your style to bring about.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 64. font-family (40) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image064.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Font-family." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>First let's talk about font family. Font families are just different
types of text. If you've used Word before, you've gone in, and you can
pick Arial or Wingdings or all these different types of fonts. You can
do the same things on your webpage.</p>
<p>I've got a couple of examples up here for you of the more common. You
have Helvetica, Courier, Courier New, Comic Sans, cursive or Verdana. I
tried to put the font type here in the slide, but it might be hard for
you to see. And I did that on purpose, because what looks obvious to you
when you're designing doesn't always look obvious to the people who are
looking at your page. I also picked these particular ones because I
wanted to show you that some are a single word, such as Helvetica. But
Comic Sans MS is multiple words, so I had to put it inside quotes.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 65. font-family, #2 (40) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image065.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Font-family, #2." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>How it works is, again, how you use your syntax rule. You have your
selector, your property, and then your value. In this case I've said
whenever you see an h1 heading, don't use the browser default heading,
instead I want you to use the Arial font. It changes the font slightly
to look like this example here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 66. font-family, #3 (41) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image066.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Font-family, #3." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Now every single browser doesn't support everything. We've seen this
even with HTML 5. Some browsers support some text, some don't. In the
same way some browsers support some fonts and others don't as well. What
you can do is provide alternatives.</p>
<p>In this example, I've given the browser three different alternatives
to use. I'm saying, whenever you come up to an h1 tag, I want you to use
the Courier font. But if you don't have the Courier font, use the Impact
font. If you don't have that one, use Arial. Now, one of questions you
might ask yourself is, what if it doesn't have any three of these fonts?
It doesn't have Courier, Impact, or Arial. Well, if you remember, when
we first talked about cascading style sheets, we said if you give it a
rule and it can't support it, it will always go back to the browser
default. So, you don't need to worry about font disappearing because you
gave it a bad font family. It'll always come through.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 67. font-family considerations (41) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image067.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Font-family Considerations." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When you pick your font families, there's a few things you should
think about. The first one is maybe the most important, is some fonts
are much more user friendly than others. There are basically two
categories. You have serif fonts and sans-serif fonts. The serif fonts
are the ones that have the fancy edges along the side that you used when
you were learning calligraphy. The sans-serif fonts are very clean,
there's no drop downs. When it comes time for someone to blow your page
up, and they want to make it look bigger. Serif fonts can really get
messy, so avoid those whenever possible.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 68. custom fonts (42) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image068.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Custom Fonts." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>I personally don't use custom fonts myself, but I've never been an
artsy type of person. If you do decide that you want to have your own
font, or some sort of special web-safe custom font, you need to use
something special here called a font-face rule.</p>
<p>What we do, is you can see in the first example, you say, hey, I'm
going to define my own font-face. I'm going to happen to call it
mySpecialFont. You can call it anything you want to call it, and then
you need to give it a source. That source, this is a new one you haven't
seen before. We're not using href, we're not using source, we're using
url. And the url says this is where you can find the file that defines
my special font. And once you do that, once you write the font face rule
once, throughout the rest of your style sheet you can go ahead and
reference it. Now every time I use an h1 font, you're going to use
mySpecialFont.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 69. font-style (42) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image069.webp" 
  alt="font-style." 
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's talk about font style. It's a much fancier word than you might
expect, but we're simply talking about do you want your font to look
normal, which is the default, or do you want it to be italic? Or do you
want it to be oblique, which is basically just a special kind of italic.
Normal font will happen no matter what if it's just how it's going to
be. If someone else has written a style sheet and they've made it all
italic, that's when you might want to say, no, I'm going to overwrite it
and make it normal. Italic is always a certain kind of lean, basically,
to your font. An oblique is when you really want to be extra special and
define exactly what angle you want to have your text lean towards.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 70. font-variant (43) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image070.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="font-variant." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The font variant, we really only have two options here. We have
normal and we have small-caps. People use this quite a bit when they're
trying to do very consistent and yet somewhat fancy look to it. Here
I've said again, always using h1, I want my font variant to be
small-caps. Now when you look at my text, my h1 text down at the bottom,
I've written &lt;h1&gt;Small caps variation.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 71. font-variant, #2 (43) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image071.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="font-variant, #2." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>But when the browser displays it, it's going to display it in small
caps. This keeps you from having to go back and forth to remembering to
change all your text to uppercase or lowercase. It doesn't matter how
you write it; the browser will always show it in uppercase.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 72. font-size (44) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image072.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="font-size." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Now font size is something that we'll be talking about pretty much
throughout this entire course and in other courses we're going to be
doing as well, such as responsive design, because it's really a lot of
different ways to do it. Let's just start with the most basic. Your
options are, you can use font size equals extra-extra-small,
extra-small, small, and smaller. I don't really like those very much,
because it doesn't really give me a frame of reference.</p>
<p>You can have medium, you can have large, extra-large, xx-large, and
larger. Very few people use these options, but they're out there so I
wanted to tell you what they were. Instead, what many people use is they
use pixels.</p>
<p>I'm going to include on the website this nice table for you that
relates how many pixels to an inch, how many pixels to picos, so you can
get a feel for it. But most people do something along the lines of 20
pixels, 35 pixels, 80 pixels. And this is a very consistent look and
it's something that people can feel what it should look like. However, I
tend to use percentages instead. Percentages are going to allow us to
change the font size as we resize the screen much more easily. If you
were to say use 100% it's going to be the default size. If you say use
110% it will be slightly larger. If you were to use 75%, it'd be
three-quarters the size.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 73. color and background-color (44) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image073.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="color and background-color." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Next, let's talk about color and background color. The color
attribute is the color of the foreground, which is the fancy word for
just the text itself. The background-color is the color of the
background behind the font that we're looking at. And depending on what
kind of text you're styling; it can look very different.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 74. colors (45) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image074.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="colors." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Here I've done one rule, and you haven't seen this before. I'm going
to style two different selectors. I'm going to style h1 and span. If you
put a comma between the h1 and the span, you can put as many commas as
you want, and write as many selectors as you want. In this case I've
said, hey, I want my color to be blue, and I want my background color to
be gray. And if you're not sure where these strange numbers came from,
go watch the colors video. It'll explain everything for you there.</p>
<p>Now I've gone in, and in my HTML, I have colors in an h1 tag, and I
have the word inline inside a span tag. And what I want you to notice is
that for the h1, the block element, the background color covers the
whole width of the page. But for span, for inline elements, the
background color only goes around just the element and the text
itself.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 75. text-align (45) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image075.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="text-align." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Next let's talk about aligning text. Aligning text is simple. It's
probably one of the easiest things you can do in HTML. And you're going
to be really happy. Because later when you decide you want to align
other things, it's so hard and you're just going to want to put
everything in text. Your options are when you use text align you can use
left, which means just align the text to the left. That's what we do
already. You can have right, which means align everything to the right,
center, and justify. Center everything as much as you, along the middle
of that division. Justify tries to spread it out to use as much space as
possible.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 76. example: left-align (46) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image076.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Example: left-align." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let me show you some examples because that's really the best way to
understand what's going on here. Here I've got a left alignment.
Everything lines up along the left-hand side of the screen.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 77. example: right-align (46) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image077.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Example: right-align." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The next one I've used text in line equals right. And you can see
that everything is lined up to the right. It looks really weird. There
are very few reasons you're going to use this. Unless you have something
else going along in the side 7in the middle here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 78. example: center (47) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image078.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Example: center." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The next one we're going to do is center. People use center quite a
bit. They almost use it too much, but it is a nice way to break up your
text and have it look a little bit different.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 79. example: justify (47) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image079.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Example: justify." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Justify is really hard to explain, and even when you first look at
it, you might not notice what's going on. But with justify, the browser
is putting in little bits of extra space to help you spread it out so it
has the exact same width all the way along.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 80. example: compare justify with left-align (47) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image080.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Example: Compare justify with left-align." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>I'm going to show you the justified with the left. And I think that's
the best way to see the difference, is that you basically don't have the
empty space here. They've spread it out over here, so no one place has
too much blank space.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 81. line-height (48) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image081.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="line-height." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Next, we're going to talk about line height, and line height is
really different because it's not affecting the font itself. It's not
affecting your text. It's affecting how much space is around your text.
Some of you may have used Word before, and you can go and just how much
space there is between the lines. Maybe you want it to be one line, one
and a half lines, double spaced. That's what we're talking about
here.</p>
<p>My first example I said line-height equal 50%. And the next one I
said line-height equals 200%. In the first rule, that's a weird rule to
write because I'm saying I want things to overlap with each other. In
the second rule I'm saying I want you to really spread out far. I'm
going to put an example later online where I can show you exactly how
these things would look. Or even better, I'm just going to turn this
into a teachable moment and have you go in there and type it yourself
and look at how these two different rules affect the text.</p>

<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image082.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="1.04. Review - Styling Your Text." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's review. I know I went over a lot of things, and it can be
overwhelming. One of the most important things is with everything we do
in this course, is take five, ten minutes, type some stuff in, take a
look and see what happens. Make as many mistakes as you can, because
this is the time to make mistakes, when you've got me and the rest of
the crowd here to answer the questions on the different boards.</p>
<p>Practice on toy problems. Don't make a huge webpage and try to style
it. Create a page with three or four paragraphs, a couple links, and
practice on those, because it doesn't matter, you don't need to practice
on a big page, you can practice on the small problems and it really
makes a big difference. And finally, if you decide that you're ready to
code and you are ready to do that large project, make sure you design
your larger projects on paper first. I can't stress enough that if you
start coding and styling without really having a clear plan, you're just
going to get very frustrated and hopefully, not hopefully, you'll get
very frustrated and you'll quit. And I don't want you to do that.</p>
<p>Plan all your projects on paper first. If you follow these
suggestions, if you practice, practice, if you do toy problems, if
before you jump into big problems you sketch it out first, I think
you're going to have a lot of fun, and you're going to have a really
great page that you're going to be proud of.</p>

<h2>Early coding</h2>

<p>One of the challenges of teaching about web design is that there are
always multiple ways to demonstrate different concepts. For this course
I am always going to choose the way that most closely illustrates our
most recent lectures.</p>
<p>If you are an experienced web designer you may certainly prefer a
different method, probably even a "better" method. But for now, I am
going to stick to the most basic of properties. I encourage you to post
in the discussion sections if you want to share alternate methods.</p>
<p>In the next module (1.5) I am going to walk you through some code. I
hope you will take the time to play with this code or make your own
version of the site. If you check the Resources tab you will find all of
the code I use in this course. If you would like to find a direct link
to this code though, you can find it at:</p>

  style="width:40%" />

<p>Hi, everybody, welcome back. One of the things I really want to stress in this 
Introduction to CSS course Is that there's this need to stop and practice and review 
what we've learned so far. I'm going to make sure that I include little things 
that I'm going to call Code Together.</p>
<p>If you're watching this right now, and you don't have your laptop next to you 
or whatever you're using to code, I really hope you'll stop, go get that, and code 
along together with me because just listening with me doesn't really give you the 
true experience you need to type it in and make mistakes as we go along together.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 84. new file, copy (50) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image084.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="New file, copy." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Okay, so let's begin. What I'm going to do in this module is I'm
going to go back to an oldie but a goodie that we did in HTML five. And
I want us to go in together and style it. Alright, let's start by making
our CSS file. I'm going to go ahead and create a new one now, go up here
to file, new file, or you can do command N.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 85. css and html separate folders (51) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image085.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Keep CSS and HTML in separate folders." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And the first thing you want to do is you want to save this as a .CSS
file, so then that way your editor knows to color things the way you
want it to color. Now, whenever I'm designing pages, I keep all of my
HTML files in one folder and my CSS files in another folder. And I
really encourage you to do the same thing.</p>
<p>I'm going to go into my CSS folder. And I'm going to call it
together-1.css. It's really important that you remember to put that file
extension, or things aren't going to work.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 86. colleen web page, old and boring (51) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image086.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Colleen's old, boring web page." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>All right, so here's my old, boring page. What people typically do is
they style from the top of the page and work their way down. I want you
to pick your own values, but let's together go ahead and style my
header. Oops, wrong thing here.</p>
<p>And we can give it a background. I'm going to try B3B3B3. We can give
it a larger font if you want. I'm going to say font size. Let's make it
150%. Just a little bit something different. I'm going to save this, and
I always really encourage students to make small changes to their code
and then check and see what happened. Let's see if we changed anything
over here. And so now I'm going to reload it and see what happened, and
if you notice, nothing happened. Well, the problem is I didn't link the
style sheet correctly to the HTML file. Remember how I told you I always
think put things in a folder called CSS? I need to include that. All
right, come back. Reload.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 87. style header colors (52) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image087.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Style header colors." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Oh, hey! I’ve got a little bit of something going on there. All
right? So, now let’s go ahead and just add a few more things. I know it
doesn’t look exactly like my example. But one of the things I want to do
next is, I want to go ahead and style, let's see, my header. Let's give
the entire header a background color. All right. You can pick anything
you like. And I'm going to pick background: I think I have 666666, all
right. And let's go ahead and I really want to align that text. I'm
going to call it text-align: center. Save, refresh.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 88. background-color: fugly (52) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image088.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Change fugly background-color." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The page is starting to look slightly different all the time. Now the
one thing that's confusing me is it doesn't appear to like my
background. Save it here. Refresh. There we go. Now these colors are
really ugly and really hard for you to see. And I realize that. Let's go
ahead and play with things to make this a little bit easier to see.
Let's go ahead and put in.</p>
<p>Let's change the h1 so it's a different color and let's go ahead and
change the navigation. So that we have, I'm going to change the font,
let's try the font variant. I like the font variant. It lets you put
things into uppercase, lowercase, different things like that. We also
have font size. I'm still not happy with the size, so I'm going to make
it 150%, and the last one I'm going to do is font family. Now if you
recall, with font-family it's very customary to give it more than one
value because not every browser supports every font-family. So, in my
case, I'm going to go ahead and try putting in Arial, Times New Roman.
If you have a font that's made up of multiple words, you need to put
them inside the quotes. And then finally just Serif. Let's see what
happened.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 89. color codes, same case (53) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image089.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Color codes, use same case." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>You can see I'm going to make it a little bit bigger, we're starting
to get there. Let's go ahead and just style a few more things together,
and then we'll go on and learn a little bit more. I would like to see
you pick your own things for h2. So h2 I'm going to pick a different
color, let's try same color 666666 and a different background. I'm going
to use 00B7EA. So, does it matter? Does it matter whether I type it as
EA uppercase, lowercase? It doesn't matter at all. The important thing
is for you to usually be consistent so you don't mess yourself up as
you're going back and forth. All right? We'll refresh again. All
right.</p>
<p>It's starting to look much different. This isn't a lot of style. It's
only one, two, three, four, five. Five rules and we already have a much
different look. I'm going to go ahead and make the screen smaller
because when I put in that font size 150%, it makes a big
difference.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 90. style summary in details (54) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image090.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Style summary in details." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>All right. One last thing I'd like you to try to do is go ahead and
try to style the summary in the details. Because if I want to make just
the details italic; I grew up in Ashtabula Ohio part, how can you make
those italics but not the rest? If you remember what the HTML code looks
like, let me show you a quick example, is that right down here I have my
details tag and if you haven't seen it before, I put the word open in
which means by default show it is open, so no one has to click on it.
I've got my details. I've got my summary where the My Childhood part
came up, and then I have all this part. If you want to make those
italics, and only those, how do you do it?</p>
<p>What we're going to start with, is we are going to style the details
tag. And I'm going to scroll up here a little bit so you guys can see a
little better, hopefully. And what I'm going to say is I want to make
everything italic, and the way you do that is you go and put in
font-style: italic. Now this isn't going to be exactly what we wanted
because what I've done is I've italicized everything. So now you want to
go back and say, but you know what? I don't want the summary in italics.
How you make it so it's not italics, by default most things aren't, you
can actually put in the word normal. All right. That's it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 91. style header/footer in similar way (54) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image091.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Style header and footer in similar way." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Now we've got this part in italics and this part in bold. For the
most part we're finished but I am going to add one little thing, because
it’s really common for people to style their header and their footer in
a very similar manner. Let's go and add style my footer. And what I want
to do is I want to give it the same background color that my header had.
Background, one, two, three, four, five, six, boom. And there you go.
What we've done now is we've gone from a very simple, basic HTML file
and we've started adding just a little bit of color, a little bit of
font size, a few different things like that.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 92. before/after colleens web pages (55) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image092.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Before/after Colleen's web pages." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let me show you what the original file looked like again and we'll
look at them next to each other. I'll comment out my style sheet. I'll
open it up and you can see these are two very different looking pages.
But they're exact same HTML. Okay great, these are the type of things
you're going to need to do for the homework in this section. Practice
here, come back and watch me, if it helps you out a little bit getting
over humps. But the important thing is, code, code, code, good luck.</p>

<h2 id="week1-06a">1.06a. Display and Visibility (Part 1 of 2)</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 93. display and visibility (1 of 2) (55) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image093.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="1.06a. Display and Visibility - Part 1." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Hi, today we're going to be talking about Display and Visibility on Your Webpage. 
Now when it comes time to making your page, again and again I'm going to tell you 
that laying out where you want things to be is key to a really effective page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 95. display is key to layout (56) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image095.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Display is key to layout." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And one of the things you need to remember is that every element we
look at is basically a box. And the box model is something we're going
to cover in a future lecture. But before we get to the specifics, I just
want to talk about some details. Because how the display on your display
element works affects all the neighboring elements on your page. Before
we begin, I just want to remind you every element on your page is a box.
Just think of it that way. And display is how you can decide whether the
boxes should be next to each other, underneath each other, and different
things like that.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 96. common values, #1 (56) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image096.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Common values, #1." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When we talk about display, there's some common values that pretty
much everyone uses or they're just a default so you've been using it
without even knowing it. Elements that are inline will sit next to other
elements, they take up just enough width and height and no more, when
you're putting them on the page. I think of these as my good children in
the minivan elements. It's fine if I want to put three kids in the
backseat. They're not going to elbow each other, they're just fine.
They're going to get along.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 97. common values, #2 (57) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image097.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Common values, #2." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The other type of display is block. And what block does is it forces
a line break in between your elements. Again, with my example, I've got
one kid who really just can't sit next to anybody else. I have to put
them in their own row. Even though she's really tiny and she doesn't
take up that much space, she has a whole row all to herself when we're
driving in the car.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 98. common values, #3 (57) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image098.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Common values, #3." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What's nice about block elements is, while they take up all of the
horizontal width and just enough height, you can go in and you can set a
height and a width on those elements. Even though it's block, and you've
reserved the whole width of the page, you can say, but I really only
want it to be 40 pixels, or half the page, or something like that. With
inline, it takes up just enough space, and you're not able to change
that. You don't get to say, I want it to be bigger or smaller. If it's
inline, that's all you get. With block you have a little bit more
flexibility, but you do have the problem that you're reserving a lot of
space. So of course, what we came up with is this idea of something that
takes the best of both.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 99. common values, #4 (58) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image099.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Common values, #4." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And this is inline-block. Elements that have display inline-block are
going to be the same as inline and that they can be next to each other,
but they'll also accept height and width. If you have two things that
want to be next to each other, but you want to give them a lot of room,
and right now they're inline. Well, go ahead, change it to inline-block,
and then you can give it a height and a width. And if you have something
that's block and you want two of them next to each, again, no problem.
Change them to inline-block and you can set the width and height.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 100. common values, #5 (58) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image100.webp" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Common values, #5." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The fourth one which we don't really use as much is the idea of
display none. And what happens here is if you have an element on your
page and you give it display none, it's as if the browser completely
ignores that it exists. It's as if it lifted it up and took it out of
the page. These four, the inline, the block, the inline-block and the
none are the ones that we're really going to start playing with at the
beginning.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 101. 3 span, 3 div, 3 paragraph elements (59) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image101.webp" 
  alt="3 span, 3 div, and 3 paragraph elements." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What I have right here is just a simple file that's going to have
three span elements, three div elements and three paragraph elements. If
you remember, span elements are inline, so they're only going to take up
as much space as they need. But the divs and the paragraphs, those are
block, so they're going to take up more space. On the side over here,
what I've done is I've added a little bit of styling, which may or may
not make sense when we first talk about it, but I gave each of my spans
a height and a width. Basically, all my elements, a height and width and
a different background color.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 102. span=green, div=blue, paragraph=pink (59) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image102.webp" 
  alt="Span=green, div=blue, and paragraph=pink." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>If we're to look at it right now. You would see that I've made all my
spans green, all my divs blue, and all my paragraphs a pinkish purple
color. And each one lays out exactly by default as how it would go. The
reason the divs are as big as they are and the paragraphs are as big as
they are is, again we put that in our style sheet.</p>
<p>You can see my height and my width. If I didn't include these by
default, these divs and paragraphs would take up the whole width of the
screen, and they'd be really small because they would only need enough
space to have that text. Let's go ahead and play with this. Normally, I
would go into my style sheet and I would put different things in, try
different displays and different things like that. I'm hoping it'll be a
little clearer for you if instead, I do this at the same time. So, you
can follow along with me with what's inspect element, or you can go
ahead and change the code in your file, save it, refresh, save it,
refresh.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 103. span element (60) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image103.webp" 
  alt="Span element." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>I got to inspect element over here by right-clicking, and what I'm
going to do now is I'm going to right-click on one of these span
elements. Inspect Element and it pops it up for me. Any element on your
page, you can play with, you can either play with just that particular
element you're poking on right there or I can say I want to play with
all the spans. Let's look down here. Right now, I have a height and a
width for each one of my span elements. But they're not actually very
big. So how do we change that? If something's inline, but you want to
give it a height and a width, we go down to display, and I'm going to go
here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 104. display: inline-block (60) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image104.webp" 
  alt="display: inline-block." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And I'm going to try inline-block. Boom, right away my spans have
taken on those properties. So before when they were inline, they were
small. When they're inline block, I can shape them really nicely.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 105. display: block (61) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image105.webp" 
  alt="display: block." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And if I'm changing them to just block, you can see now they're on
top of each other because block elements don't like to be next to each
other. The final property I'm going to show you right here is this idea
of none. When you have none, it's as if the spans didn't even exist. You
didn't save any space for them, it's not as if you would even know
looking at the page that they were ever there. Kind of interesting thing
to do and you might use it later if you want things to appear some times
and not others but you don't want to leave a big white space.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 106. div, inline-block and block (61) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image106.webp" 
  alt="div, inline-block and block." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Go ahead and take a second and I'm just going to click on a few of
the other things. For instance, my divs, I can go and I can say, you
know what, I want to make just this one div, I want to make it
inline-block, and let's see what happens. Well, the odd thing is I
changed it and nothing actually happened and I'm wondering if you know
why. When you have inline-block, you're saying oh, go ahead and put me
next to other people if I fit.</p>
<p>If your neighbors are also block, it's not going to work. Now,
instead of changing just one, I'm going to change all the divs. And you
can see that, oh, because they're about 45%, two of them fit next
together but the last one doesn't. There's really no good way to feel
comfortable with display until you take this code and start switching
things around.</p>
<p>What happens if it's inline? What happens if it's inline-block? What
happens if it's span? And pay really close attention to the fact that
it's not enough to know what the display is for the one element you're
working on, you also need to know the display for its neighbors. But,
let's go ahead and talk a little bit more.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 107. complementary properties (62) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image107.webp" 
  alt="Complementary Properties." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When we're talking about display, it's pretty common to also talk
about two other properties as well. And these are called float and
clear. And what float and clear do is they don't necessarily say where
you want the page to be, the element on your page to be specifically,
but where you generally want to put it. By default, when the browser is
putting things on the page, it starts in the upper left-hand corner. And
it just starts putting them in, so looking at your site, it'd be like
first thing, first thing, oh, the next one is block so I better put it
underneath. And it just keeps adding things in. If your browser's really
big, you can fit more span elements next to each other, if it's small,
you can fit less.</p>
<p>Well float lets you actually reposition things, and it says hey I
want you to float this anywhere, and if I say float right, I want you to
put it as far to the right as you can. If I say float left, I want you
to put it as far left as you can. The other elements are basically aware
of one another, and when you use float, they won't overlap but things
are going to look a little bit crazy. And when you add float again,
you're affecting your neighbors because your neighbors need to know
where you're going. Which is why we have this additional property called
clear.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you're coding, you want to just make sure that things
aren't floating to your left or your right. You want that space all to
yourself, in which case you can use clear left, clear right, or clear
both. Clear left to make sure there's nothing floating to you on the
left. Clear right means there's nothing floating to you on the right.
And clear both, well as you can guess, it means nothing should be
floating next to you at all.</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and take another look at one more example where I'm
going to play with that same code but I'm going to start using float and
clear as well. We're going to look at the same exact file we were just
looking at when I was playing with display block, inline, none, etc. But
now, we're going to throw float and clear into the mix as well.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 108/109. code and website (63) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image108.webp"
  alt="Example Code."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image109.webp"
  alt="Example Website."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>Here is the code we're looking at, and here's the website. And the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to play with the spans up here
and I'm going to try floating them. Remember, when you float something,
you're basically saying put it as far over to the side as you can and
the other elements are almost going to act as if they're not there but
they're not going to overlap it. I'm going to go down here, go to my
float. Say float.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 110. example website (63) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image110.webp" 
  alt="Example Website." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Now, the first thing I'm going to do is I'm just going to float it to
the left, which means they're not really going to move too much. What I
want you to look for is that right now, there's a little bit of space
between each one of my spans. When I change it to left, that space goes
away and the div actually goes underneath it as well, because the spans
are on top. Now when I try changing it and floating it right.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 111. float: right (64) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image111.webp"
  alt="float: right."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When I float it right, I want you to notice that not only do they not
have space in between them, that they're right next to each other again.
But if you look, the order of the A, B, and C is different. Because the
first elements it's placed on the page is span A and so it moves it as
far to the right as it can. And then when it's doing span B, it's moving
as far to the right as it can, and span C as well. This is kind of
something interesting, and you can see that if they were to the left,
the divs would overlap them.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 112. div, float: left (64) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image112.webp"
  alt="div, float: left."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>All right, so let's go ahead and do a few more of these things. And
I'm going to do a change all my divs, so that they are also. Let's go
here, float left. By now the page is looking crazy because things are
going all over the place and you really, you probably don't want it to
look this way. Particularly if we wanted all of our paragraphs to really
be at the bottom of the page. I'm going to go up here to my
paragraphs.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 113. clear: both (65) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image113.webp" 
  alt="clear: both." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>I'm going to say, I'm not going to float these. Instead, I'm going to
say I'm done with floating, please stop floating things around me. And I
am going to clear both sides. The paragraphs are now saying, get me away
from all this floating craziness. I just want to be down here. Floating,
clearing, different things like this.</p>
<p>When we do these really simple code examples in the lecture, they're
not always going to make as much sense as when you're putting them in as
part of something bigger. But the problem is I can't show you examples
of something bigger because you'd all fall asleep about three or four
minutes into the code. So go ahead, do what we've always been doing and
just play with these a little bit until you get the idea of what they
do. As time goes on, you'll start to figure out when you want them to
actually do these kinds of actions.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 id="week1-06b">1.06b. Display and Visibility (Part 2 of 2)</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 94. display and visibility (part 2 of 2) (1.06b.)(65) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image94.webp" 
  alt="1.06b. Display and Visibility - Part 2." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>One of the things you may have noticed as you've been going through
other code is that sometimes when you mess with the height and the width
of an element. You find out that it no longer is big enough to hold all
the text that you wanted to show.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 114/115. element overflow (65) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image114.webp"
  alt="Element Overflow."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image115.webp"
  alt="Overflow."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>What can you do when the content doesn't fit any longer inside the
box that you've made with your height and width? You can use a property
overflow to determine how people are going to be able to access that
content, or if they're even going to be able to access it at all.</p>
<p>The four values for overflow, include visible, which basically means
if you've drawn a box. And there's a whole bunch of text inside of it,
the text is actually going to go outside the box. No matter what, the
content is visible even if it goes outside the lines.</p>
<p>Hidden does pretty much the opposite. It says, if you have something
inside this box and it's too big, it's gone. You can't see it. Now this
isn't a great idea, because it's going to cause problems if the user
increases the font size on their browser. If you've made some sort of
600 by 800-pixel box, and you think, oh this'll be great, no problem.
Anyone will be able to read this. What's going to happen if someone goes
in and increases the font size? Your box doesn't get any bigger, but the
text does, so they might not be able to see the content.</p>
<p>A third option is to give overflow scroll. And what this will do is
it will actually give a horizontal and vertical scrollbar to the
element. Even if it's just a paragraph, all of a sudden, your paragraph
has a scrollbar so people can see everything that's in it.</p>
<p>The final value is auto, and what it does is it says, oh, I'm only
going to add scrollbars as needed. Depending on how the person's viewing
the site right now. I'm going to go ahead and list some resources to
show you some examples of how overflow looks. But for right now, we're
going to go ahead and keep moving on.</p>
<p>Because what I wanted to share with you is this idea of other display
values. Again, browsers are always changing. HTML5 and future versions
are always changing and they're trying to add new support. The problem
is when you see these new cool tools they don't always work on every
browser. So inline, inline block, block and none will work
everywhere.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 116. other display values (67) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image116.webp" 
  alt="Other Display Values." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>But here are a few more that are slowly beginning to gain acceptance.
And those are table, grid and flexbox. For grid and flexbox, I'm going
to leave it to you to kind of play with it. But I did want to show you
an example of where a lot of my students find the table display really
helpful.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 117. display:table (68) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image117.webp" 
  alt="display:table." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>How a table display works is that you don't make an actual table with
your HTML code, nor do you have the tag table. But you're telling your
browser that you want to structure it as if it is a table. You would
make any type of containing element
<b><mark>display:table</mark></b>. And then anything that you
want to line up in nice columns, you would use
<b><mark>display:table-cell</mark></b>. This sounds very
confusing so I wanted to make sure I gave you an example to go through
with me. I have here a div, a couple divs with some paragraphs in it.
And what I wanted to do was I wanted to make sure that they didn't have
all the exact same content.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 118. divs side-by-side (68) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image118.webp" 
  alt="divs side-by-side." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>As you can see, each of the divs is now next to each other because
we've told it we don't want them to be underneath each other. But this
really isn't what you were hoping for it to look like.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 119. div, float: left (69) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image119.webp" 
  alt="div, float: left." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's go ahead and try adding that float left. Save, I'm going to go
ahead over here and refresh. And you can see, it does look a little bit
better. This is great because we wanted everything to be next to each
other. But what I'm going to do now is I'm going to show you something
that doesn't work out really well. And that is this idea of when I
resize it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 120. div, overflow: scroll (69) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image120.webp" 
  alt="div, overflow: scroll." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Now you can see this idea of that the overflow might be really
important because now things are going outside the divs themselves.
Plus, I really don't have any type of margin between them. Let's go
ahead and add overflow, Hidden, or scroll, just to show you what I was
talking about there for a second. I'm going to go ahead and refresh it.
And now you can see that everything is contained within the content box,
and I can actually go in here and I can scroll each and every one of
these. I'm actually not a huge fan of this, because I don't like that
people would need to know that they can scroll.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 121. div, width: 30% (70) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image121.webp" 
  alt="div, width: 30%" 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>We're going to try something new here, instead what I'm going to do
is set the width to 30%, and I'm going to go ahead and use the
inline-block. And let's take a look at what this looks like now. I need
to remember, I'm using a new style sheet, so I need to go in and change
my HTML so I'm using that style sheet. The number of times when I was
coming up with these examples for you where I forgot to change the style
sheet, or I forgot and named it wrong was really embarrassing. I'm
hoping you'll avoid those same problems I had. Over here I'm going to
refresh it. You can see this is not the look that we are hoping for. It
resizes, but it's just not doing what we want because each one has its
own particular height because we really want it to just fit that.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 122. div, display: table-cell (70) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image122.webp" 
  alt="div, display: table-cell." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>This is where table cell comes in. I'm going to change my display
from inline block to table cell. And for once, when I go to hit refresh,
I'm going to actually know why this doesn't work. But I want to show
you, when I hit refresh, it looks actually okay right here because it's
made it so that it all works out. Now depending on what browser you're
on, this may not work. Because what you really want to say is, if I'm
going to go ahead and make this used table cell, don't forget to go into
your body and say display.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 123. body, display: table (71) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image123.webp" 
  alt="body, display: table." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>All right and I'm going to refresh and it's going to look the same,
it's just going to be a better coding style. Now, I'm going to try to
put a lot of examples of coding in here, in this CSS course, so you can
play with it. But I can't stress enough that, sometimes it's not going
to work exactly the same for you, because you might be using a different
browser. You might be using the same browser, but a different version.
The most important thing is for you to go in there, and keep trying
these new values, seeing what happens and playing with it. When it comes
time for your final project, that's when to be really specific about
making sure that everything looks good on every browser.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 124. visibility (71) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image124.webp" 
  alt="Visibility; visible, hidden, collapse." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The last thing I want to mention very quickly was this idea of
visibility. And it specifies whether or not an element is going to be
seen by a user. Now we talked about this earlier when I talked about
display none but what goes on visibility is you can actually see that
space was left for it. There's just nothing there.</p>
<p>When you use visibility, the options are visible, hidden or collapsed
if you're using tables. If you see this and you're wondering what the
difference is between display and visibility. Just remember that with
displaying none the browser acts as if it's not even there. You don't
see anything. With visibility hidden, the browser is going to leave the
space that that element would take up, it just doesn't show it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 125. review (1.06b.) (71) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image125.webp" 
  alt="1.06b. Review - Display and Visibility." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>So finally, let's go ahead and review. Display is just one tool of
the many we're going to use for positioning the elements on your page.
Early design, deciding what you want your page to look like before you
start coding, is going to make things easier. Don't code thinking I want
to use float right design, and then decide oh, I'm going to have to use
float right here.</p>
<p>Utilize all the different tools we have, such as inspect element, to
see your different options. And it's going to make your coding life so
much easier. We want to avoid save refresh, save refresh. Instead, use
those tools and you'll find that you're making really good decisions in
your design and your code. Thanks.</p>

<h2><mark>Code Placement - read</mark></h2>

<p>When you write code, it is important to get into the good habits of
organizing your code. While there are no specific rules about how and
where to place your code, there are definitely conventions. (Conventions
are suggestions that most programmers follow. This way other programmers
can quickly and easily understand their code.)</p>
<p>The most common organization is to have one main folder with your
html files in it. There are also subfolders (folders inside the main
folder) for your CSS files and image files. (In this example I also have
JavaScript files.)</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 126. folder with subfolder nested within (73) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image126.webp" 
  alt="Folder with subfolders nested within." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When we use CodePen we use that idea of separating our code. However,
be aware that CodePen doesn't require many of the things you should have
in your code. For instance, in the HTML files it ignores all of the
information in the <b><mark>&lt;head&gt;</mark></b> section.
If you develop in CodePen, make sure to test your code later using the
proper folder/file structure. You will need to include links to the
style sheets and images.</p>
<p>It can be very frustrating at first to master folder. However,
understanding folder structures will help you, even if you never code
again.</p>
<p>I am going to end with a screen shot of my computer.</p>

<p>My css folder is in the SAME directory as my html files.</p>
<p>My link will be:</p>
<p>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"&gt;</p>
<p>It is important that you even use the proper case. Because on some
computers it matters and this would not work<b>:</b></p>

<p>Hi everybody welcome back. It's time for us to start coding. One of
the things I've noticed over the past couple years of teaching is that
students really differ in the way that they jump in and handle different
types of coding classes. Some will sit down at the computer, never read
the book and just hack, and hack, and hack. Some of you may be a little
bit guilty of doing all the readings, listening to all lectures, but
never actually trying out any of the things we've talked about. So
that's what this homework is for. A chance for you to finally go through
and put down some of this code and see what goes on when you try to
apply styling to your HTML.</p>

<p>I've put the links here above, but it's really going to be much
clearer when I show you the homework in action. Let's take a look at
it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 137. ultimate, before menu (79) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image137.webp" 
  alt="Before Menu." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When we start, I'm going to give you three HTML files that are really
not well styled. They start off, they have a navigation, they have three
very large pictures, some are smaller. And then they have the content.
All three pages that you'll look at, home, teams, and history have
different content.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 138. after menu (80) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image138.webp" 
  alt="After Menu." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What I want you to do is write your own CSS rules that will take
these types of pages, and turn it into something that looks like this
(above). Now, I know this isn't a huge jump, but this is exactly how I
want you to start coding. I want you to make small, incremental changes
that can take you from something that's hard to read to something that's
much easier to read. Let's go ahead and step through the different
things that you'll need to change in order to achieve this separate
look.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 139. leave html alone (80) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image139.webp" 
  alt="Leave HTML alone." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The most important thing to understand is that you must leave the
HTML alone. I don't want you to change it at all, instead I only want
you to style things and edit things within the style sheet. And the
things that you're going to need to add are styles for the header, the
headings, the section, the links and the images. Let me go through and
show you exactly what you need to look at.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 140. header (81) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image140.webp" 
  alt="Header." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>For your header, it's pretty straightforward. I want you to go in and
I want you to add a background color.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 141. h1 and h2 (81) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image141.webp" 
  alt="h1 and h2." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>For your headings, both h1 and h2, I want you to change the font
color. Now remember, this is different from the background color. It's
the color that the text shows up in. Next, I want you to make sure that
all the headings are displayed in capital letters. So, if you go back,
we'll take a quick look. You can see that watch your head and ultimate
frisbee are in capital letters, while in the original HTML version,
they're in lower case. So, I want you to use CSS to make that
change.</p>
<p>The next thing I want you to do is just for the h1 heading I want you
to center the text.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 142. section (82) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image142.webp" 
  alt="Section." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Next make one quick change to the section part of your HTML. I want you to style 
the different section so it has a different background color from the other elements 
in your page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 143. links (82) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image143.webp" 
  alt="Links." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Next, let's take a look at the links. The changes you're going to make here 
are very subtle. They're not very obvious if I didn't specifically tell you what 
you're looking for. And what I want you to do is I want you to change the background 
color, and the font color, for your links. After you've done that, go in and center 
the text, similar to the way that you're going to the center the texts for the h1 
headings.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 144. images (83) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image144.webp" 
  alt="Images." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Finally, the last thing that really messes up our HTML page initial
example is these huge pictures that just get in the way. For now, since
we haven't talked about the best way to style images, I want you to
remove them from the page. But remember, this might be the trickiest
part of the whole assignment because I don't want you to change the
html. I want those pictures to be there. I just want you to use CSS3 to
remove them from the page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 145. before/after homework (83) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image145.webp" 
  alt="Before/after homework." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>I hope between looking through this example and looking online, and looking 
at my before and after shots, that you'll be able to do this homework assignment.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 146. peer grading (83) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image146.webp" 
  alt="Peer Grading."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When you're done, we're going to be using peer grading. When we do
this, grades are going to be based on basically how well you were able
to finish what we were doing. When I talk about aesthetics, I'm talking
about did you pick pretty background colors and font colors. We don't
really care about this.</p>
<p>This is our first homework assignment. I really just want you to feel
only success. However, proper standards do apply. And what I mean by
that is don't use color names, use hexadecimal or RGB, and don't put all
your rules on one line. Make sure your CSS style sheet is easy to read.
Other than the styles that I listed please don't change other things for
right now. It makes it much harder to grade. But don't worry. As we go
through this course you will have the chance to put in your own unique
looks as your styling elements. For right now all I can say is good luck
and make sure you go on those discussion boards if you have any
questions.</p>

<h2>Week 2 Resources:</h2>

<h3><b>Code:</b></h3>

<p>Here is a link to the CodePen repository for the Week Two code. You can play 
with the code to test the different concepts.</p>
<p><a href="http://codepen.io/collection/DVYVpB/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://codepen.io/collection/DVYVpB/</a></p>
<p>Here is a list of the lectures this week 2 that use CodePen, and the name of 
each file that they use:</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 id="week2-01">2.01. Box Model</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 147. box model (2.01.) (85) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image147.webp" 
  alt="2.01. Box Model." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Hi. Today we're going to talk about the box model. And what the box
model is, is really a general concept of CSS that helps you size and
place your element where you want them to go.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 148. height and width (85) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image148.webp" 
  alt="Height and Width." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>One of the first things we're going to talk about is height and width. I know 
I've already used this a little bit in some of my other lectures, but I wanted 
to be very specific in how it works. And one of the first things you need to know 
is that the height and width of any inline element is the content itself. So, if 
you have a link, the height and width of that link is just the text of the clickable 
part of the link.</p>
<p>Elements that are not inline, things that are block, inline block, things like 
that, they can take height and width properties, and we saw this in the Display 
lecture. Any time you have something that's inline, if you give it a height and 
a width, the browser just ignores it. Anything else, the browser goes great, I 
can go ahead and change that for you.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 149. border, #1 (86) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image149.webp" 
  alt="Border, #1." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Some of the other things we want to think about then, when we have
elements, is how they fit on the screen. One of the easiest ways for you
to strategically place things on your page is to put borders around
them. Even if you don't want those borders later in your final product,
I find it's very helpful to have this idea of how much space an element
is taking up. Any element can have a border around it whether its
inline, or block, or inline block.</p>
<p>And those border properties specify what style border you want, what
width of border and what color. They're pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>The border style is the only one that must be specified. If you don't
specify a color, or you don't specify a width, no problem. It'll default
to black and probably one pixel. But you have to decide what kind of
style you want.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 150. border, #2 (86) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image150.webp" 
  alt="Border, #2." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>In this case, I've said, for all my divs, I want them to have a solid
one pixel border around them, and I can't tell you what color that is,
because I'm not quite that geeky yet, but I'd guess something like
blue.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 151. border-style (86) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image151.webp" 
  alt="Border-style." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The border style that you want to specify, while most people always
use solid, there's a lot of different styles. You can use dotted,
dashed, grooved, ridged, hidden, inset, outset. There are a lot of
different things you can do, and it’s really kind of a stylistic
difference on your part. I don't really pay much attention to them
because I've always just used solid myself. Once you've decided what
kind of style you want, you can specify the width and color.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 152. border width and color (86) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image152.webp" 
  alt="Border Width and Color." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When it comes time to set the width, if you decide to, is you can set
it in a number of pixels or you can use the key words, thin, medium, or
large.</p>
<p>When it comes time to do the color, you can do the same thing we've
been doing all along. You can just use the name, such as blue, the RGB
value, the hex value, or just so you know, it's also transparent. It can
just take the color of whatever's underneath it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 153. specifying individual sides (87) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image153.webp" 
  alt="Specifying individual sides." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When it comes time for you to specify how big you want your border to
go, you can specify in four different ways.</p>
<p>In the first example, you just give it one number. In this case,
three pixels. And what it's going to do, is it's going to put a 3 pixel
border around the entire element just like this. If you decide to give
it two values, is it's going to set a 3 pixel border on the top and the
bottom, and a ten pixel border on the left and the right. This is a
really common way to set things up when you're doing borders and other
properties, because it's a really nice shorthand that's still very
simple to understand and read.</p>
<p>If you give it three values, it's a little bit trickier, and I always
stumble over what it is, so I'm going to pop the picture up just to make
sure. The first value is always the top. You want your top border to be
3 pixels. The 10 pixels is for the left and right, and the 20 pixels is
for the bottom. The last one is when you give four values, and when you
give four values, that basically means top, right, bottom, left. And
that's going to set the border to four different values.</p>
<p>Most people either use the one value, the four values, and a few
people use the two values as well. Mostly, and one of the reasons I show
this to you is, it can be really intimidating, and you're wondering what
people are doing when they're going on. This is what they're doing.
They're using shorthand’s so that they don't have to have border right,
border left, border top, border bottom.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 154. margin (88) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image154.webp"
  alt="Margin." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Margin is basically that space that's outside of your border. It's
between, when I say you and your neighbor, or what I should really say
is between the element, and the element's neighbor. It gives you that
elbow room where you don't want anybody touching you. With margins,
whenever you give it a positive margin, you're basically saying, move
your element to the right or down. If you give it a negative margin,
you're actually having it move closer to the neighbor. You are having it
move left or upward.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 155. padding (88) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image155.webp" 
  alt="Padding." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Padding is very similar in concept to margin, but instead this space
is between the element and its border. It's giving it a little bit of
extra space inside. You might almost think of it as squishing the text
in some cases. In the same way, whenever you have positive values for
padding, you're moving it outward from the element. You're giving it
more space. If you give it a negative padding, you're actually moving
the border close to or maybe even on top of the elements that are next
to it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 156. margin and padding, #1 (89) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image156.webp" 
  alt="Margin and padding, #1." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>With margin and padding, all you're going to do is give a numerical
value. You're going to give it something like 3 pixels or 10%. You don't
give it any type of color. It's always going to be transparent. The
padding is always going to be the same color as the element, and the
margin's always going to be the same color of the parent, probably the
body of the page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 157. image, margin and padding (89) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image157.webp" 
  alt="Image, box model, margin and padding." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>They, just like the border, can be defined in that one to four
values. If you put margin three pixels, it will be a three-pixel margin
around everything. If you say padding, ten pixels, five pixels, you'll
have top, bottom, left and right.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 158. additive height and width (89) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image158.webp" 
  alt="Additive, height and width." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>So let me show you a quick picture of what I'm talking about. In this
case, here is my text is my actual element. I've said this is what I
want to go on. The blue is the border around my element. The yellow is
the padding. It's that space between my text and the border, and that
orange is the margin, and what you're saying is, don't put me near
anything else. Give me this much space around myself. So, it might move
your paragraphs down. It might move your divs down and over. So, just
practice this. And as you play with it more and more, it'll make more
sense which one's a margin and which one is the padding.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 159. additive height and width (90) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image159.webp" 
  alt="Additive Height and Width."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>One of the things you need to understand when you're doing padding
and border and margin, and all these things is that in HTML says, your
height and your width is additive. What that means is if you decide that
you want the width of your element to be 200 pixels, you probably need
to take into account how big all those other aspects and properties
are.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 160. margin+border+padding+width (90) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image160.webp" 
  alt="Margin + Border + Padding + Width = Actual Width." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>So, in this case, part of the width is the margin, plus the border,
plus the padding, plus the actual element width itself. And so, it all
really adds up to get what we consider the actual width of your element.
And this is going to matter when you're looking at your page and you're
designing it and trying to decide how much space you want each element
to take up.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 161. div, width/height/padding/margin/border (91) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image161.webp" 
  alt="div, width, height, padding, margin, and border." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>If we look at this example right here where I have the width is
100px, the padding is 10px, the margin is 5px and the border is 1px. I'm
hoping that right now, you're doing the math in your head, and I promise
not to give much more math than this, but you're doing it to figure out
how much width does this element, does this div, actually need on the
page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 162. width=132px (91) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image162.webp" 
  alt="width = width + padding + margin + border * 2 each."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And in this case the width is 132 pixels. The 100, plus 10, plus
five, plus one, plus one, plus five, plus ten. It all adds up.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 163. height=82 (91) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image163.webp" 
  alt="Height = height + padding + margin + border * 2 each." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The height, in the same way, is your height plus the top and bottom
padding, top and bottom margin, and the top and bottom border.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 164. centering an element (92) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image164.webp" 
  alt="." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>All right, so when we talk about margin, I just wanted to throw this
slide in even though it doesn't mesh with a lot of the other things
we've been necessary talking about. But it's because margin is very
important for when you want to center elements on a page.</p>
<p>When we want to center text, we could just use text align center, and
everything looked really good. But when you want to center elements,
it's a little bit more difficult. And so, the default way to do this is
to use the command margin zero auto. If you remember, that first zero,
that stands for top and bottom, and so it's going to not really care
about that. The auto is what puts it left and right. Now this is only
going to work if the element happens to be display:block, if the element
is not floating, is the element has a width that's not auto, which means
that you set it. And this last one is if the element is not fixed or
absolute position.</p>
<p>Now I haven't covered position yet. And so, the good news is, since I
haven't covered it, you probably haven't messed with it, and you don't
have to worry about these two things. But as you try to send your
elements, come back to this slide if you need to, and check these off to
make sure that all these properties fit. And that's the best way to
center things right now.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 165. box-sizing (93) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image165.webp" 
  alt="box-sizing." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Finally, when we talk about this, I want to add one more option, and
that's called box-sizing. And what box-sizing does is it takes some of
the math out of that additive height and additive width. What your
options are is you can have content-box, so box-sizing content-box, and
that's just your default additive. You're going to have to remember how
much space you're using.</p>
<p>The next one is called border-box. And border-box actually takes the
width, the content, the padding, and the border all into consideration.
So, if you say you want the width to be 200 pixels, it's not going to
actually make the element 200 pixels. It's going to make it 200 pixels
minus the padding and border. One of the last things to remember is that
we'll take into account padding and border, it won't take into account
margin.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 166. measurements (93) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image166.webp" 
  alt="measurements."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>So finally, one of the things I'm going to be showing you in this
example in just a second, is different ways you can set the height and
width of different elements. And there's two common ways to do this.</p>
<p>The first one is called absolute, and that's when you set an element
to a specific size. You say I want it to be so many pixels, or so many
millimeters, or so many centimeters. Pixels is a very common way to set
sizes. The other type of measurement is what I call fluid, and it sets
the size relative to surrounding elements or the parent elements. You
can use things such as percent. You can use
<b><mark>vw</mark></b>, which stands for viewport width,
<b><mark>vh</mark></b> which stands for viewport height. You
can even use things such as <b><mark>em</mark></b> and
<b><mark>rem</mark></b>, which aren't commonly used, but they
actually set the size relative to its parents.</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and move to my example so we can play with this just a
little bit. It's not going to be enough to demonstrate everything that
we can do, but hopefully it'll get you started. What I have here is a
very simple HTML file where I have a left side and right side. But as
you can see, they're not to the left and the right now. They're just on
top of each other. The first thing I want to know is, can you put these
divs next to each other? We're going to have to use a kind of
combination of display, and height, and width, and padding. Let's go
ahead and do that.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>The code I am about to play with here is boxModel.html and
boxModel.css. Make sure you play with this code and try to get it to do
what I am about to do.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 167/168. html and css (94) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image167.webp"
  alt="HTML on the left."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image168.webp"
  alt="CSS on the right."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>Over here in my CSS file (to the right), right away you can see this
background things I've done. Now, when you want things to be next to
each other, you have to give them a width, because right now they take
up 100%. One option would be for you set it to some sort of pixels. And
say maybe 200 pixels and 200 pixels, and see what would happen, see if
it works out.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 169. width = 48% (95) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image169.webp" 
  alt="width = 48%." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The problem with doing that, as I uncomment my code here, is that as
people go on different browser sizes, your numbers might be too big or
too small. What I've done here is I went ahead and I set my width to
48%.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 170. display: inline-block (95) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image170.webp" 
  alt="display: inline-block." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Now doing that is really great, and I'm going to come out of this one
line for just a second, because most people get that idea that you want
to set the width to something smaller. What they forget, is that even
though they're only taking up 48%, in fact I'll even just make it
something really small.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 171. remove display: inline-block (95) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image171.webp" 
  alt="Remove display: inline-block." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>20%, they're not going next to each other. You need to remember that
you want to use those fluid measurements. Let's go back here, I'm going
to put it back to 40%. Even if you make it really skinny, until you tell
the browser, oh, I know this is blocked but I'm going to change it to
in-line block, it'll never let block elements be next to each other.
That's why you have to remember to do both of those elements. Let's go
ahead and save and reload.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 172. set to 50% (96) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image172.webp" 
  alt="Set width 50%"
  style="width:40%" />

<p>You can see that I've done my width. I've done my display block. I've
got my padding. I've got my border, and I've got some margin. The last
thing I'm going to do, just to end this up to show you what's going on.
Let’s change this to 50%, because this is a really common mistake people
make. They say oh, I want two things next to each other. I'm going to
make them each 50%. Don't forget when you do that, it doesn't work
because that's 50% before you put the border into account. Make sure
that you're playing with all these things, that you're playing with the
margin, you're playing with the padding, you're playing with the border.
Because that's how you're going to get things to work, by tweaking,
tweaking, tweaking.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 173. review (2-01 box model) (96) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image173.webp" 
  alt="2-01. Review: box-model." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When it comes time for you to start implementing all these ideas,
your box model with your padding, content, margin, etc., you really want
to design sketches on paper first, because it's really hard to shove
things in after you've already come up with an outline, all right?
Design first, code second.</p>
<p>The second thing you might want to do is use the box model to reduce
the complexity of your code. Or at least the complexity of your math
trying to figure out what things fit where. Finally, no matter what you
do, you need to remember that margin always has to be considered. It can
be tricky when you first start trying to put your page together, and
getting things to go exactly where you want them to go, and we haven't
even talked about positioning yet, which would be even another
element.</p>
<p>For right now, practice these things in small ways. Use Inspect
Element to play with it and not have to change your code so much. Until
you get things looking just the way you want them to look. And don't
worry, we're all making mistakes. We're all doing this together. But I
think your page is hopefully getting closer and closer to something that
you would really want to put out on the web. Good job.</p>

<h3>Coding Together</h3>

<p>In the next module (2.2) I am going to walk you through some code. I hope you 
will take the time to play with this code or make your own version of the site. 
If you check the Resources tab you will find all of the code I use in this course.

<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image174.webp" 
  alt="2-02. Code Together."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Hi, everybody, welcome back. Once again, I'm going to ask you to stop
learning and start coding and practicing. And we're going to use the
same example we used in our first coding break.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 175. old page (98) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image175.webp" 
  alt="Old Web Page." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>I wanted to show you what our old page was, right here. And see how
we can change it into something that looks a little bit more like our
new page over here, where we've been implementing some of our margins,
paddings, and widths and heights. All right, so let's go ahead and get
started.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 176. use same css (98) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image176.webp" 
  alt="Old same CSS."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The first thing I want to do is use the exact same style sheet I used
for the first one. There's absolutely no need to recreate your style
sheet when you can either just use this one and amend it, or if you'd
like, use two style sheets. I'm going to use just one. And the first
thing I'm going to fix is the fact that I made what you might call a
mistake in my earlier version. I have two rules styling h1. That's not a
problem. The browser will apply all these styles. But what I really
meant to do was I meant to style the body tag.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 177. get back to original website (99) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image177.webp" 
  alt="Reset back to original web site."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>So, let's take a look at what it looks like right now. And let's go
back to our current version. And there we go. That already looks a
little bit better than what we used to have. All right, so now that I'm
on a good starting place for when I start, let's talk about the
different things we can style in our page, all right?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 178. add margin (99) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image178.webp" 
  alt="Add margin." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>One of the first things I want to do is I want to add a little bit of
margin to my page. If you look over here, there's not much space between
the edge of the page and the actual browser. I want to add just a little
bit. You can add a little bit, you can add a lot. In fact, while we code
today, I'm going to add a lot, just so you can see the effects. How do
you do that? How do you add that space between the element and its
neighbors? You go in and we're going to add a margin. And, like I said,
I think I’m going to make it a little bit more pronounced than in the
code I showed right there. I’m going to go ahead and make it 4%. When we
do this, I’m going to go back to the page. I’m going to reload. And you
can see everything is moved in, all right? Margin just adds a little
space and makes it more visually appealing to your users, all right?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 179. more space between border and element (100) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image179.webp" 
  alt="Add more space between border and element."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's think of some other things that we want to do. Clearly, I
probably want to add a little bit of space between my links and the
bottom of the text. This is a little bit different. I'm not saying to
separate the elements, I'm saying I need more space between my border
and the element itself. In that case, what we want to use isn't margin,
we want to modify the padding. Let's go in and see where we think we
would do that. All right, so I need to add padding inside the whole
header. I'm going to change it to, padding, again you can pick anything
you want. You can use pixels, you can use percents. I'm just going to
put in pixels. And I'm going to say please add 15 pixels of space
between the border and the bottom. Make sure I save.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 180. add padding around entire thing (100) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image180.webp" 
  alt="Add padding around entire thing." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And refresh, and you can see I've added padding all the way around
the entire thing. If I really only wanted padding to be on the bottom, I
could have said padding bottom, or padding right, or padding left. All
right, let's go ahead and style something else.</p>
<p>One of the big things I changed is that instead of having one
underneath each other, I've changed these so they're next to each other.
Remember, by default, sections are block, they're display block, which
means don't let anyone else come next to me. In order to change it so
they're next to each other, we can either use inline or inline-block.
Almost always when given this choice, you're going to use inline,
because when you use inline-block, you can include a height and a
width.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 181. add new tag (101) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image181.webp" 
  alt="Add new tag." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>All right, go back to my CSS file. I don't want to change the header.
I think I'm pretty good with h1. The nav, the h2, oh, you know what? I
don't have anything that I can change here, so let's go ahead and put in
a new tag. Section, all right, I want all three of these sections next
to each other. What I could do is I could pick maybe 400 pixels each.
Well, that would mean that the browser has to be at least 1,200 pixels.
I could pick 150 pixels each. Well, that means they're going to be
really skinny even if they don't need to be. Let's use percentages. I'm
going to use 30%, not 33%, because I want to give a little bit of elbow
room for paddings, margins, borders, etc.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 182. at 30% still not next (101) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image182.webp" 
  alt="Added 30%, still not next to each other." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>All right, let's go ahead and look at it right now, I want to see
what it looks like. You can see I've made it 30%, but they're still not
next to each other. That's because they're still block.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 183/184. display: inline-block (102) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image183.webp"
  alt="display: inline-block."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image184.webp"
  alt="refreshed."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>


<p>Let's change them to inline-block, Display. And let's hope for the
best. There we go. I've got all three things next to each other. Still
not looking exactly the way we want, but it's step by step. It's making
this little bit of progress at a time. I'm going to go ahead and fix
this fact that they aren't all lined up at the top.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 185/186. float: left (102) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image185.webp"
  alt="float: left."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image186.webp"
  alt="refreshed."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>And I'm going to say float: left; refresh and we're getting closer,
we're getting closer, but there's something still a little bit wrong
here. First, they're squished. I don't like them all squished together.
So how do you separate different elements from each other? How do you
add a little bit of space between elements? All right, if we were in
class, I'd have that one student that's like ooh, ooh, I know, yes, it's
margin.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 187/188. margin-right: 2% (102) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image187.webp"
  alt="margin-right: 2%."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image188.webp"
  alt="refreshed."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>Let's say margin-right. And I will make it something small like 2%.
All right, we're getting closer. We're getting closer. Still not quite
what we wanted, but this is how it works. You add a little bit. You
adjust. You add a little bit. So, one of the big problems here is that
when you float things to the left, or when you float things, once you're
done floating when you don't want those next elements to float. You
actually have to go in and say, oh, but I don't want to float this part.
Once we're done with these three sections, we don't want the footer to
also be have them next to them.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 189/190. footer, clear: both (103) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image189.webp" 
  alt="clear: both."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image190.webp" 
  alt="refreshed."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>Let's go in and adjust the footer code. Down here. All right, if you remember 
if you don't want things to float next to you, we're going to use clear: both, 
which means don't let anything float on either side of me. Oh, much better, right? 
It looks much, much better. And other than the fact that I've got weird colors, 
we're very close to right here. I actually like the gray on the header and the 
footer so I'm going to leave it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 191/192. set image 75px (103) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image191.webp"
  alt="Set image 75px."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image192.webp"
  alt="refreshed."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>


<p>But what I do want to do, is I want to make that picture smaller.
This little icon right here, let's make it look a little more like this.
And that's very simple for the approach we're going to use right now.
Let's go ahead. I'm going to add an image. And I'm going to go ahead and
just hard code it right now. So, I'm going to make it 75 pixels. Oops,
going to have to say width:75px. Let's take a look at how we did. Yeah,
that looks okay. If I didn't like it and I wanted to play with it, I
wouldn't go in here and try 100 and then 80 and then 52.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 193. set image 150px (104) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image193.webp" 
  alt="Set image 150px."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What I would do is I'd go in here and do Inspect Element again. And I
would, oh, make this much bigger because otherwise everything looks
really crazy. And I would go into the image and I'd say, okay what does
it look like if instead I make it 150 pixels? Does that look better?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 194/195. finally, set width 125px (104) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image194.webp" 
  alt="Set width 125px." 
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image195.webp" 
  alt="refreshed."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>Or what if I make it 125 pixels? Do I like that? Pick a value you
like, and once you find something that looks good to you, copy that
value into the style sheet. Because if I refresh it right now, my
inspect element values go away. All right, let's go in here, fix it,
save it, and refresh.</p>
<p>All right, so this is great, these are the types of things I want you
doing in this class. I want you grabbing an HTML file and saying ooh,
can I change this around? What can I do to make it different? Clearly,
this page we've created right here isn't a finished product. It's not
exactly how you'd want it to be out there on the web.</p>
<p>We're going to keep learning new things and we're going to keep
styling things in different ways. And as you keep practicing, your
confidence and your ability is really going to grow. And that's what I
want. I want your confidence to be very, very high by the end of week
four that you can do this. So good luck.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 id="week2-03">2.03. Styling Links and Lists</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 196. styling links and lists (2.03.) (105) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image196.webp" 
  alt="2.03. Styling Links and Lists." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Today we're going to talk about styling links and styling lists. When
it comes time to style the links on your page, it's really important
that you remember links are what make up a website. It's that
interconnectivity that helps people gain knowledge. It's what helps
search engines help link your text and content to somebody else's text
and content.</p>
<p>Today we're going to talk specifically about links because I want you
to think about how you're styling. In general, when you go to style a
link you can use all the same different attributes that you've been
using for everything else. Your headers, your paragraphs, things like
that. However, links do have one special additional property called
text-decoration.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 197. anchor links, #1 (105) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image197.webp" 
  alt="Anchor links, #1."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>In this example right here, what I have going on is that instead of
having my links be inline, which means they go next to each other, I'm
going to say, hey, I want my links to be separated, one on top of each
other. Hopefully, most of this code looks familiar to you. You have this
idea that the display is block, it'll go underneath each other. The
font-weight, I want it to be a little bit bold. I've set a new color and
a new background color.</p>
<p>Now I've set a width, and, if you try to set a width and it doesn't
work, just remember, links by default are inline and they don't take a
width unless you change them to block or inline block. I also am going
to align the text, add some padding, and this text decoration, none,
this is new. This says, hey, I want to get rid of that underline that
usually shows up underneath links.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 198. anchor links, #2 (106) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image198.webp" 
  alt="Anchor links, #2." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>I've gone from this up here in the top corner to something that a
little bit more styled down here at the bottom. In fact, it almost
doesn't even look like a link at all. Let's talk about that.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 199. buttons, #1 (106) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image199.webp" 
  alt="Buttons, #1." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Sometimes when installing their links, people really try to make it
look much more like buttons. And we want to avoid that because we want
to be semantic. If you want a button, use a button element instead.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 200. buttons, #2 (106) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image200.webp" 
  alt="Buttons, #2." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And you can do that very simply by just putting in the button tag
instead of the anchor tag. And again, in the same way you can style it
in many different ways. But what I want you to understand is there are
so many different things you can do with links and so much styling you
can do with them, make sure that people understand that it's a link that
they're looking at. Or, if they're using a screen reader, it's a link
they're hearing about.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 201. states (107) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image201.webp" 
  alt="States."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Another new thing about links, that we haven't seen before, is this
idea that links have states. Have you ever noticed that, when you go to
a web page, sometimes some of the links are blue, and some of them are
purple? And, you realize, after a little bit, the ones that are purple,
they're there because you have visited them, before.</p>
<p>What we have, are we have these different states. And I'm going to go
over them very quickly and later, when we talk about what are called
pseudo classes, we'll talk about them even more. But quickly, an ‘a’
with this colon right here link simply says this is just a normal link,
you've seen it before, <b><mark>a:visited</mark></b> says
here's a link and my browser tells me. It knows that I've clicked on it
before. By browser default, it will be a different color. We also have a
link with the hover activity over it. You've probably seen that when you
hold your mouse over something, kind of like I'm holding the pen over
here. Is that it'll do something crazy. Maybe it'll change the color or
different things like that. Hover is activated by holding your mouse
over a link. Which brings up an interesting question of does this work
on touch screens?</p>
<p>When you're developing your page, you need to remember that hover
isn't necessarily going to work if people are accessing it on a phone or
a tablet. Which brings me to another state called
<b><mark>focus</mark></b>. The <b>focus</b> state is
what happens when somebody is tabbing through your page. As they hit tab
it's going to jump from element to element. And when it gets to this
particular link, it's going to know I'm in <b>focus</b>, so if
you want to do something different, maybe the same thing you do when
people hover, this is how you can trigger that activity.</p>
<p>The last one is the one I really think is the weirdest one of all, I
would maybe even call it dumb, but I didn't create the Internet and HTML
and I respect, but it's really weird, because what this one says is hey,
this is the link just as I'm clicking it. And the reason I think that's
weird is because for most of us, when we click on a link, we're going to
a new page so we're not even going to see what styling happened. All
right? Let's go ahead and talk about how we do these. But before I do,
once again we are coming back to this idea of precedence. Cascading
style sheets are very big on this.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 202. precedence of rules (108) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image202.webp" 
  alt="Precedence of rules."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>If you decide that you want to use these different states, there are
a couple of rules you need to remember when you're writing your style
sheets. One, if you're going to use
<b><mark>a:hover</mark></b> and
<b><mark>a:visited</mark></b> must come after
<b><mark>a:link</mark></b>. And next,
<b>a:visited</b> must come after <b>a:hover</b>.
It's just this hierarchy that's going on while you're coating your
pages.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 203. style 3 links (109) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image203.webp" 
  alt="Style 3 links." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's look at an example now of some code and how I'm styling my
links. In this example, what I have here is I just have three links that
I haven't styled in any way. I've got a link to introduction to web
design, a link to the University of Michigan, and a link to Kent State
University, which is where I did my undergrad.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 204. more style 3 links (109) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image204.webp" 
  alt="More style 3 links." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>But what happens when I add some CSS to it? Up here on the top I have
all the typical things we've been talking about before, the width and
the color. I've added the text decoration, and what I also wanted to add
is this idea of margin where I can center each of my links one on top of
each other with a little bit of space in between them. All right, so
let's take a look at what that looks like and you can see I have each
links looks really much different, okay.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 205. hover, color change (110) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image205.webp" 
  alt="Hover, color change." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And you can see when I see my pen, when I hover over each one of
these, what happens is the color changes. How I got that to work is
right over here. Whenever my link goes into a hover state, it knows to
change the background color and the font color. Okay, well what is
<b>a:focus</b>, and what I've got down here a little bit,
<b>a:active</b>? What's going on here is that I've put in the
<b>a:focus</b> for those people that are tabbing through my

focus, and then the University of Michigan, and then Kent State, and I'm
doing that by tabbing through the page.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 206. active rule (110) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image206.webp" 
  alt="Active rule."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The last rule, the active rule, is something that I'm going to show
you and then break off from there. How the active works is that when
you're actually clicking on a page, it's going to add a border around
that link. Now, the odd thing is that as soon as I'm done clicking,
we're going to go to a new page. It breaks off, you don't really get to
see that border unless I hold it down very deliberately. In this
example, I tried to show you the two different ways that you can style
links. Now let's go on and think about this in a little bit more
detail.</p>
<p>When you style these links, once again I can't stress enough the
importance of accessibility, we want to make sure that your links are
links and that people know that they're there. Once you're done playing
around with links, let's go ahead and start thinking about styling list
items.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 207. styling lists (111) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image207.webp" 
  alt="Styling Lists."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When you style lists, the default properties they all look the same.
You've got the one, two, three or the circle, circle, circle, but we can
change all that, we can change things beyond the font and the margin to
look at the style that your lists are taking on.</p>
<p>Some of the things we can look at are your list-style-type, your
list-style-image. The list style position, and just the list style
itself. The list style type basically says how do you want me to
indicate the different list items?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 208. list-style-type, #1 (111) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image208.webp" 
  alt="list-style-type, #1." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>By default, for ordered lists again, we have the one, two, three, but
you can give different values.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 209. list-style-type, #2 (112) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image209.webp" 
  alt="list-style-type, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>You can say I want it to be lower roman numeral, upper roman numeral,
lower alpha numeric, you can play with these to get the feel you want.
In this case we've gone from 1 and 2 to A and B. And if instead I had
done lower alpha, we'd have had lowercase a and lowercase b.</p>
<p>When you do list-style-type for unordered lists, typically what you
have, and it depends on your browser, is the little circle or the little
disk. We can change that, and we can put in exactly what you want to
make sure it's going to be.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 210. list styles, #1 (112) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image210.webp" 
  alt="List styles, #1." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Another option that you can play with is this idea of getting rid of
those default markers altogether, and instead, using a custom image
instead of that traditional marker. And when you do this, it brings up
back to this idea of the list-style position. Many times, you're going
to move your position over, depending on which list-style you're
using.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 211. list styles, #2 (113) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image211.webp" 
  alt="List styles, #2." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Up here I've got an example of where I'm saying I want my list style
image. I've got square first, this says, hey, if you can't find the
picture go ahead and use square, otherwise I want you to use this
picture.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 212. list.html example (113) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image212.webp" 
  alt="list.html example."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's look at another example. In the file list.html, what I put in
here are two different types of lists, an unordered list and an ordered
list. And I just kind of filled them in with some different information.
And when you look at this screen, which</p>
<p>I'm going to make a little bit bigger for you here, if I can. You can
see that the unordered lists are just using the circles, and the ordered
lists are using the default numbers. Let's play with this now.</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and put in a style sheet. In my style sheet, I've gone
in there said, what I want to do with my list styles is I want to switch
it to upper-roman and numeral and also use a square instead.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 213/214. before and after (114) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image213.webp" 
  alt="Before."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image214.webp" 
  alt="After."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>This is what it looked like before (left), and this is what we look like afterwards 
(right). You can see, there's just a little bit more something to it. And, this 
is a very simple way to change your page up from how other people typically do 
their page.</p>
<p>One other option I just wanted to show you, because everyone really likes this, 
is that idea of using the list style image. I'm going to go down here and uncomment 
this code out. And if you remember, if you've been paying attention to this idea 
that when you have precedence this new rule down here is going to overwrite all 
the rules above it. Let's make sure I've saved my page, and reload.</p>

<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image215.webp" 
  alt="Add lightening bolts."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And now in this case what's happened is that we've removed those
regular markers and I've put my little lightning bolt inside. Doing
things like this are not difficult, but to be honest it takes a little
bit of time, especially if you're using images, to make sure you've got
everything written exactly the same way. Typos are really the killer.
It's not a matter of it being difficult, it's a matter about you just
being very careful when you're doing these things.</p>

<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image216.webp" 
  alt="2.03. Review: Styling links and lists." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Okay, so let's go ahead and review what we've been talking about so
far. And not just in this lecture, but in the course as far we've gotten
today. And what I want to emphasize is that until now, we've been
styling tags, and these tags can always just take these property value
pairs and you can transform your page into something really great.</p>
<p>We're about to go into something new and a little bit different.
We're going to talk about pseudo-classes and IDs and selectors. And I
want to make sure that you're comfortable building these different rules
on your own before you progress. Now being comfortable does not mean
that you're perfect. It doesn't mean that you know how to do everything.
What it does mean is that you are confident enough to go out and start
using some of the tools that are out there to improve your site. I'm
listing two of them right here just because they're both very well known
in the case of the Chris Pederick site, or I personally just found them
really helpful.</p>
<p>Another option is you can go out there and do a web search for
developer tools. You're not the first, and you're not going to be the
last person to run into problems when you're styling your page. My
overall hope would be that you would really go on to the forums in the
Coursera course or in whatever classroom you're in and ask your fellow
students for help. Because really, the only way to learn is to practice,
practice, run into problems, get some help and keep going. As you do
more and more web design, I'm hoping that you're gaining the confidence
to help make something really cool that you're going to proud of. So,
stick in there. Thanks.</p>

<h2 id="week2-04">2.04. Advanced Selectors</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 217. advanced selectors (2.04.) (116) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image217.webp" 
  alt="2.04. Advanced Selectors."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Hi, today we're going to be talking about advanced selectors. Up
until this point, when we've been writing our rules, we've been writing
our rules for a specific type of tag. We've been saying h1 or p or h2.
We've just focused on one thing that covers all the different elements
of that type. But what if you don't want to style all of the links, just
some of them? Or you don't want to style all of your lists, you just
want to style some of them?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 218. css selectors (116) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image218.webp" 
  alt="CSS Selectors." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Well, now we're going to talk about these types of advanced selectors
that will let us do just that. CSS is going to give you so many options
that in this lecture I'm going to try to cover as many as I can, but
it's still going to be up to you to go off and look up some more on your
own as you need them. Let's start with the CSS selectors that follow the
DOM. If you remember the document object model is how the browser breaks
up your page into a tree-like structure. In this way, the browser
actually knows if a paragraph comes directly after an h1 tag or if two
paragraphs are siblings in the same section. We're going to utilize that
to style just certain parts of your page. So descendant selectors are a
way to say, hey, if you're inside a nav tag, I want you to style all the
links that are inside the nav tag. Instead of doing all of them, just
those ones.</p>
<p>If you want to be even more specific, you can use the child
selectors. This rule is very similar, except it says, all the “a” links
need to be what we call direct descendants of the nav link. If you have
a paragraph in there and you have some links in there, ignore that. They
need to be directly underneath each other.</p>
<p>The final one is adjacent sibling. That’s not one I actually use very
much in my own coding, but I wanted to let you know what it is because
there’s a really good chance you’ll see it if you’re looking at other
people’s code. How the adjacent sibling works is that the elements must
be what we call the same level and follow each other. If you have a
section that has an h1 and then an ordered list, they would be siblings.
If you had an h1 and then some other things and that ordered list was
inside a paragraph, it wouldn't work that way.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 219. id selectors, #1 (117) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image219.webp" 
  alt="id Selectors, #1." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Next, we're going to talk about what we call id selectors. ids are
used to identify a single element in the DOM. The way ids work is that
you would go in, and you would, in your HTML, say something along the
lines of id equals header, or id equals footer is one they used to use a
lot. Then in your style sheet, using the pound symbol, you can identify
which ones that you want to style.</p>
<p>Right now, there's a small movement, but it's growing a little bit,
to move out of the use of id from CSS. They're saying there's really no
point in using that because a lot of people just really use this id for
JavaScript and things like that. But again, this is something you're
going to be seeing a lot, so I want to introduce you to it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 220. id selectors, #2 (117) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image220.webp" 
  alt="id Selectors, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's see an example really quickly here just on the screen of how it
works. In my HTML, I would go ahead and put in my source, my alt tag,
but also id="mainLogo". Then, in my style sheet, using the # symbol
along with the id name, the browser's going to know, oh, whenever I see
one of those images, I want to make sure I add this border and this
margin.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 221. class selector, #1 (118) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image221.webp" 
  alt="Class Selectors, #1." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Class selectors are similar to ids, but the difference is, that
classes can apply to a range of elements, not just one particular
element in the DOM. Think of thumbnail images or the social icon medias.
It's this idea that, you know what, I want to be able to style a big
group of things all in the same way, but I don't want to necessarily
style all of them that way. You don't want all of your images to be
thumbnails, but you want a lot of them to be.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 222. class selector, #2 (118) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image222.webp" 
  alt="Class Selectors, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>You would write this code in a very similar manner. Over here in my
HTML, I have class="thumb", class="thumb", class="thumb". And in my CSS,
instead of using the #, you need to make sure you use the period or dot,
along with the class name, and then you can give it any rules. And this
way, the page is going to go through and know that in addition to any
styling you just put on images, you also want this styling for the
thumbnails.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 223. classes vs ids (119) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image223.webp" 
  alt="Classes vs ids."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Just to try to help you make it a little bit clearer, what's the
difference between using classes and ids? Well first, you want to make
sure you know the syntax. The period is for classes, and the pound is
for ids. You can't mess up on this, because the browser will not fix it
for you if you put the wrong thing in front of your class or id
name.</p>
<p>You want to remember that classes can be used multiple times. It
makes sense in your HTML code to see class="thumb", class="thumb",
class="thumb" because it's not supposed to be a specific part of the
page. With ids, it should be unique, you should only see id equals, for
instance, header, which we're not even using once. You should only see
id="main section" once.</p>
<p>So again, let's think of images and navigation bars. It's very common
that you want to format numerous, but not all the images the same way.
And you would use classes for that. Where you might use an id is, I'm
sure that you've been at some places where on the webpage, you see the
navigation bar, and the page that you're currently on is styled just
slightly differently. And that makes sense because you can only be at
one page at a time, and that's why you might choose to use the id. Let's
go through a quick example using that navigation bar.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 224. sample html with 4 links (119) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image224.webp" 
  alt="Sample HTML with 4 links." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Here's a sample HTML file, where all I've done is put in four links
that don't even really go anywhere. I've commented out the style sheet
just so you can see what it would look like without any styling.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 225. home, interests, resume and hobbies (120) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image225.webp" 
  alt="Home, Interests, Resume, Hobbies." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>You can see, I've got my Home, Interests, Resume, Hobbies, and I have
one additional link down here that I very badly called here. Let’s try
adding a little bit of styling using these advanced selectors. Go over
here. You can see that I've used the child element of, actually, just
kind of the descendant of, hey, all the links that are in the navigation
bar, I want to style differently, I want to give them a different
background color, a different width, things like that. In addition,
anything that's class current, I want to make even different than any
other link or anything else we've seen that way. Let's uncomment the
style sheet. Save it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 226/227. before/after nav links styled (120) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image226.webp"
  alt="Before nav link styled."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image227.webp"
  alt="After nav link styled."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>Go from this to this. You can see that only the links that are inside
my navigation bar are styled. This one was left the same. And the one
where I have class="current" does look different from the others. It's
really simple to use these things, you just need to know about them.</p>
<p>As your pages get more advanced, you're going to want to narrow the
scope of some of the rules. We only want to apply them to certain
things.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 228. narrowing the scope (121) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image228.webp" 
  alt="Narrowing the scope."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And one of the notations you can use for that is the dot. In your
style sheet, you would actually have
<b><mark>p.main</mark></b>. This means go and find all the
paragraphs that are using the class main. Or you might have header
<b><mark>img.special</mark></b>. This would mean find all the
images that have image classical special that belong in the header. It's
just a way for you to reduce what's being styled. On the same hand, you
can also, what we call, expand the scope. Let's say that there's some
sort of styling you want to apply to both the header and the footer, or
to the sections and the articles. Not a problem.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 229. expanding the scope (121) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image229.webp" 
  alt="Expanding the scope." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What you do is you write the element, and you include a comma right
there to let it know. Just as a quick review. And this is something from
much earlier. You need to think about what happens when there are
multiple rules for the same selector. You might have this one up here
with the paragraph where it has certain qualities it wants to share
between paragraphs h1, the id main, and the class special. But later, if
you want to have additional styling for a paragraph, as long as you put
that somewhere below, it's going to override and combine with anything
that's higher up. Unless a rule has the exclamation point important
after it, it always just uses the last one it saw, along with the
earlier ones that don't conflict.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 230. more attribute selectors (122) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image230.webp" 
  alt="More Attribute Selectors." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>In addition to the element selectors and the different DOM
relationship selectors, we also have a few more that I want to talk
about briefly. The first one is the universal selector, which is the
star or the Shift eight on your keyboard. What this one does is, it'll
apply your styling to every single element on the page. It's absolutely
crazy. I'm not going to do it. I'm going to let you do it, but go ahead
and put in a star, and then the style, maybe border, around every
element. It affects everything on your page. Sometimes, it's nice for
debugging.</p>
<p>The next one you might want to think about using are what we call
attribute selectors. Instead of going on the tags, you go on the
attributes that go inside the tags. In this case, it would want to style
every link where you have href="info.html", and I'll do a quick example
of that in just a second. But before I do that, I wanted to mention two
more that we'll be looking at later, which are pseudo-classes and
pseudo-elements. Just another level of distinguishing just certain
things you want to style on your page. But first, let's go ahead and
look at using these attribute selectors.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 231. attribute selectors (122) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image231.webp" 
  alt="Attribute Selectors." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The way that attribute selectors work is that they search the DOM for
elements that have the attribute that you are looking for. For instance,
you might want to look at all the images that use gif files or all the
images that have empty alt text or maybe all the links that go to
government sites or non-profit sites or educational sites. It's really
easy for us to find those and go ahead and style them a little
differently.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 232. using operators (123) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image232.webp" 
  alt="." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>How we do that is we use operators to match the different parts of
the alt text that you're looking for. Up here, in what we call the
caret, it's going to match the beginning. In this case, it would match
all those links that start with http://umich, and it doesn't matter how
it ends. The next one with the dollar sign is going to match the end
exactly. It's going to find every file that ends in .webp. We also have
the wildcard, where you're going and saying if you see umich in any part
of any hyper reference at all, apply this rule.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 233. links and extension types (123) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image233.webp" 
  alt="Links with different extension types." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What we're going to look at is we're going to look at a file that has
different links and each one has a different type of extension that we
want to style differently.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 234. link lists; org, gov and edu (124) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image234.webp" 
  alt="Different extensions; gov, org, edu." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>All right. What I have here is just a list of links. There's no
classes. Nothing special about these, that goes to different university
sites, organizations, government sites, and if you take a look, by
default, it's just going to show up as your traditional blue links with
underlined, the text right there.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 235. different extension, different background (124) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image235.webp"
  alt="If different extension, make different background-color." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>But what I want to do is I want to go in and say, you know what, all
the ones that end in .org? Make them one color. All the ones that are
.edu, another color, and all the ones that end in .gov, a third color.
Let's see what it looks like.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 236. yellow=org, gov=green, edu=purple (124) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image236.webp" 
  alt="If org then yellow else if green then gov else if edu then purple." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Here, you can see that without me having to put in any information
inside the tags themselves, the browser has colored them the proper
color. Okay, I've just covered a lot of stuff in a very short section.
You need to realize that these ideas are going to merge together. You're
going to be using classes, you're going to be using
<b>ids</b>, you're going to be using
<b>attributes</b>.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 237. element may have multiple classes and/or id's (125) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image237.webp" 
  alt="Elements may have multiple classes and id's."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And the important thing I want you to know is that when you are adding all these 
things together, the order that you write classes and different ids in your text 
doesn't matter. It doesn't matter whether you have special early dark or dark early 
special. What really matters is the order that you write your rules in your style 
sheet. Browsers are always going to start at the top, and apply each rule.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 238. use other's style sheets (125) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image238.webp" 
  alt="You can use other's stylesheet to style your code." 
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Now the good news from this lecture is that I want you to realize
that with the power of classes and ids and this cascading style sheet is
that this means you can use style sheets from other people to style your
code. And you can just add a class that changes the one little attribute
that maybe you didn't like about it. You can override these style sheets
and make it your very own. Just make sure that you link your style sheet
last.</p>

<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image239.webp" 
  alt="2.04. Review: Advanced Selectors."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>All right, we've covered a lot, and I'm hoping I didn't overwhelm you
with the video. I just want you to remember that when we do type
selectors and the things that I'm going to have you do in this class is
that we usually are adding them to narrow the scope of where rules are
applied. We don't want to style everything. We only want to style
certain things.</p>
<p>An <b><mark>id</mark></b> is used to specify a specific
element in a page, and <b><mark>classes</mark></b> are used to
associate elements that really tend to have the similar look. As we go
on, I know I'm going to have some code-with-me examples. I hope you'll
stop, get out your laptop, and code with me to get an idea of how
powerful these different things can be. Thanks.</p>

<h3>Shorthand rules</h3>

<p>As you have probably picked up by now, I love my Sublime editor. It
does lots of great things for me, but sometimes it offers suggestions
that I didn't really mean to use. One common example is that I often
unintentionally switch between using background and background-color.
Does this make a difference?</p>
<p>For the most part no. The background property can take a number of
different values. Think about the border example we did in the Box Model
lecture. This code;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>border: 1px solid black;</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>is shorthand for;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>border-width: 1px;</b></p>
<p><b>border-color: black;</b></p>
<p><b>border-style: solid;</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, when I switch back-and-forth between background and background-color I am 
doing the same sort of thing...using the shorthand. What other things can go in 
the background property? Here is an example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b> background: #00ff00 url("imgs/ocean.jpg") no-repeat fixed center;</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This rule sets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>background-color</li>
  <li>background-image</li>
  <li>background-repeat, and</li>
  <li>background-position</li>
</ul>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 240. browser capabilities (2.05.) (127) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image240.webp" 
  alt="2.05. Browser Capabilities."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Today we're going to talk about browser capabilities and what you can do to 
make sure that your sites have a consistent appearance, regardless of how people 
are accessing it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 241. browsers differ (127) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image241.webp" 
  alt="Browsers Differ."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Even though HTML5 has really been pushing the browser developers to
all come to this consistent implementation, they really differ in
display and adherence to the new tags that are coming out. And as
browsers update and change and new browsers come out, you're going to
have to keep in mind that not everybody is looking at your page the same
way that you are. It's your responsibility to make sure that your page
works for a wide audience. And while we've been talking a lot about
accessibility, and different ways to access the web, it even comes down
to the most basic browser implementations.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 242. handling stylistic differences (128) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image242.webp" 
  alt="Handling Stylistic Differences."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>First, let's talk about handling these stylistic differences. The
easiest way to eliminate browser differences is for you to make
something called a default style sheet. And in that style sheet, you
would actually go in and wipe out any of the browser defaults for the
different elements that are styled. When you go in and you make it you
would take, P, H1, H2, all the headings, all the different semantic tags
and you would go in and you would say, I want them to have padding of
zero and margin of zero. Even my list items shouldn't have any
decoration at all. While this will ensure that you have a very
consistent look, I have to admit it's going to make you page look
absolutely horrible. But that's the price you'll pay so that when you
start writing your own styling rules, you can improve and inevitably
improve and your page is going to look better and better. Otherwise, if
you don't use what we call this default style sheet, you're going to
design your page, and it's going to be really hard for you to remember
if you've actually checked off each element that you're using.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 243. handling unsupported properties (128) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image243.webp" 
  alt="Handling Unsupported Properties."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>One of the other things we want to talk about is handling what we
call unsupported properties. So first, we know that all browsers don't
support all the HTML5 tags. You've seen this already, in some of the
coding you've done with me.</p>
<p>In the same way, not all the browsers support all the CSS3
properties. There are some properties that look really cool on some
browsers, but they aren't handled by default in other browsers.</p>
<p>But there is a way around that in many cases. And what this is, is
that the browsers are offering prefixes. Sometimes they call them
browser prefixes, sometimes vendor prefixes, but the important thing is
that it's a really quick fix for handling all the unsupported options
that you might come across. Now, when I first saw browser prefixes, I
was completely intimidated. I didn't know what was going on, and it
looked a little weird, and I was feeling lazy and I didn't want to deal
with it. But I'm here to tell you, it's actually very, very easy to use
these prefixes.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 244. browser prefixes (129) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image244.webp" 
  alt="Browser Prefixes."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's take a look at what I'm talking about. You've been using
different properties and the browser's hopefully just been working. But
now, for some of those properties, you're going to want and add a prefix
or a little bit in front of it, such as webkit, moz, ms, or o for Opera.
Each one of these prefixes say, hey, if you're on this particular
browser, this is what I need you to do to get the look that the designer
is going for.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 245. often unsupported properties (130) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image245.webp" 
  alt="Often Unsupported Properties."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What are some of these properties that are often unsupported? They
include column-count, which is a way to add multiple columns into your
paragraphs or divs. It's a really nice way to break up your text that's
responsive. If somebody resizes the page, the paragraphs actually
resize.</p>
<p>We have another thing called border-radius, which people really love
to use because it adds a little rounded edge to the borders of your
elements.</p>
<p>A third option would be gradient. And gradient is a very cool
background color that lets color go from one shade of blue to maybe gray
or red or anything like that. And it gives it a different appearance.
Now there's no way for you to really know which properties are supported
and which ones aren't.</p>
<p>I have this link here to a site called caniuse.com. And what
caniuse.com does is it lists the different properties and it tells you
which browsers support them and which ones need the prefixes. It's a
good idea to check that site out as you start developing your page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 246/247. browser differences (130) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image246.webp"
  alt="Browser Differences, #1." 
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border displayed"

<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image248.webp" 
  alt="More Browser Differences."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>But for now, let's go ahead and look at an example. In this example,
I have a file called prefixes.html. And I just want to show you quickly
what it looks like on both Chrome over here, and also on Safari. They
look pretty similar. But there are little spaces where the font might
not match exactly, or some of the spacing might not match exactly. If I
wanted to get rid of that, if I really wanted to make sure that the
pages look exactly the same, what I can do is add a default style
sheet.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 249. set default style sheet (131) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image249.webp" 
  alt="Set default style sheet."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's go down over here, and I'm going to say hey I want to use my
default style sheet. And what that looks like is it's a really crazy
file where I've listed all the different elements. And then after that,
put in things like, I don't want any padding, I don't want any margin.
If I've got lists, get rid of the list style. Make this really as ugly
as you can.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 250. browser differences (132) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image250.webp" 
  alt="Browser Differences, slight."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>If I go back over here, you might not see a huge difference because
the browsers are already pretty plain, but you can see things move over
slightly. We get rid of a little bit of stuff. And in the same way, when
I refresh the Safari, they're going to look a little bit more
similar.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 251. column-count & browsers (132) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image251.webp" 
  alt="Using column-count with different browsers."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Now, let's go ahead and look at that example where some of the
properties aren't supported. And I'm going to go back over to my HTML
file, and I'm going to say, hey, I want to use my style sheet to go
ahead and style some things that aren't always supported. And the things
that I'm talking about specifically is, we're going to start with this
idea of column-count. How column-count and column-gap work is you tell
the browser how many columns you want and how much space you want
between those columns.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 251. again, column-count (133) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image251.webp" 
  alt="Using column-count, again."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Now, when I refresh, you can see it's gone from being all one long
kind of block paragraph to that everything's split up. And it's really
cool because it's dynamic.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 252. support multiple browsers (133) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image252.webp"
  alt="Support multiple browsers."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>If I re-size the browser, everything kind of moves around. And this
is a really cool thing way to do it. One of the other things I'd like to
add just as something to look at, is this idea of instead of having a
square, I want to round the edges a little bit.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 253. border-radius (133) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image253.webp" 
  alt="border-radius."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>You do that by adding in what's called the border-radius. Now I'm
going to stop before I refresh the page, because I want to point
something out to you in case you're as intimidated as I was when I first
started doing this. The border-radius is just a simple property that's
been around for a while.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 254. add prefixes for browser compatibility (134) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image254.webp" 
  alt="Add prefixes for browser compatibility."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And you can see it right here, and you give it a value. Same with
column-count and column-gap. This whole idea of adding prefixes just
means, take your regular property and slap these prefixes on it. You
don't need to learn anything new; you just need to remember the prefix
names. I want you to really try to embrace this, and realize you're not
doing anything too spectacular. I've made it 25. And I'm going to go
ahead and refresh it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 255. curve edges (134) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image255.webp" 
  alt="Curve edges."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And as you can see, I've curved the different edges around the side.
The last thing I'm going to do is add a gradient to the color. Right
now, I'm a consistent blue color. And it's important that no matter what
you give a background color, that you would like to be used, is the case
the gradient isn't happening.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 256/257. linear gradient - blue to light gray (135) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image256.webp"
  alt="Before: Use linear gradient to go from blue to light gray."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image257.webp"
  alt="After: Use linear gradient to go from blue to light gray."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>Now for linear gradient, you're giving two colors that you'd like to
be seeing at the beginning and the end. I have regular blue. And now
when I refresh, I go from a blue to a light grey. I want to remind you
that when you're developing, don't try to memorize things. Don't try to
remember how to do everything.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 258. dynamically inspect for curve (135) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image258.webp" 
  alt="Dynamically Inspect."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>I'm going to right-click on here, and do Inspect Element. Because if
you decide later that's too much of a curve, or you don't like that
color, what you don't want to do is type, save, refresh, type, save,
refresh. It gets really annoying.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 259. use inspect to change border radius (135) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image259.webp" 
  alt="Use Inspect to dynamically change border radius."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Instead, I'm going to go right here to my section and I'm going to
look, and you can see in Inspect Element that it said I didn't use the
moz prefix, and I didn't use the Opera prefix, because I didn't need to.
I'm Chrome. What I can do is come down here to the border-radius and
change it. Instead of 25 pixels, if I want less of a curve, I can make
it 5 pixels.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 260. change dynamically the post to .css (136) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image260.webp" 
  alt="Make changes dynamically until your ready to update the styles.css."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>You can see it happening in real time. If you want to make it look
crazy, you can make it 50 pixels. You can also use percents if you like.
So put in 15%. You may play with these things dynamically and once you
get a value that you really like, copy and paste it into your CSS file.
Browser prefixes are something to play with that can be fun. But also,
it can be frustrating.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 261. automated ways to include prefixes (136) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image261.webp"
  alt="Automated ways to include prefixes."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>But the most important thing is that you should realize it's very
straightforward. One of the things that you might do as you're adding
prefixes is that realize, for right now, the easiest thing for you to do
is add those prefixes by hand. Put in the property that you want to put
in, say border-radius. And then go in and add webkit, moz, the different
things like that.</p>
<p>When you start using prefixes, what you're going to do is you're
going to add them by hand. If you know that you have border-radius,
you're going to go ahead and do border-radius and then add that moz, the
webkit, different things like that by hand.</p>
<p>As you become more experienced and maybe you want to try different
things, there are ways to automate the addition of those prefixes. If
you're using an editor such as Sublime, you can actually put little
packages on there where you can control whether or not you want Sublime
to add on those packages whenever they see different properties.</p>
<p>You can also use outside programs that will dynamically change your
code as people load it to only put in the prefixes that they need. If
you remember in my example, even though I was using Chrome, my style
sheet still had all the different prefixes. This would automatically
only add the ones you need. Again, these are kind of cool, but let's not
worry about them right now. For now, let's focus on the basics.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 262. review: browser capabilities (2.05.) (137) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image262.webp"
  alt="2.05. Review: Browser Capabilities."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>To review, when you start coding, when you start making style sheets,
you're going to want to think about using a default style sheet to
remove those stylistic differences. And when you do that, I need you to
think about some things.</p>
<p>First, should that default style sheet be internal or external? And
hopefully you all said external. Because if it's internal, it's going to
override all the other things you've worked so hard to do. In that same
way, when you put a link to your default style sheet, make sure it's
first. Because the way browsers work is it goes style sheet, style
sheet, style sheet. If you put yours first and then the default style
sheet, it's going to overwrite everything cool that you've done so
far.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that browser prefixes can help remove some of those
differences caused by unsupported options. But you don't want to overuse
it. Don't slap a prefix on every single property just because you're not
sure. Instead, you want to go to those sites like canIuse.com and test
it out and really make an educated guess as to whether or not you want
to use it.</p>
<p>You're really getting far in this whole web development idea. And
hopefully you're styling some really cool pages. And I want you to be
able to use all the different properties that are out there. Don't be
intimidated by the idea that you might have to use style sheets that you
haven't written or that you have to use browser prefixes. You've totally
got this and I know that you can code using these different tools. Good
luck.</p>

<h3>Browsers</h3>

<p>Things with browsers are always changing, updating etc. It makes
recording videos a dangerous decision, since almost anything I say may
be outdated, or will be outdated soon. For instance, in the video you
just watched, I used the prefixes for border-radius, but I am fairly
certain that it is supported by most of the browsers now. I even went to
<a href="http://caniuse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
caniuse.com</a> to check it out.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 263. -ms prefix for ms browser (138) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image263.webp"
  alt="Add -ms prefix for Microsoft browser."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>But when I checked on column-count it showed that the prefixes are
still needed.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 264. -ms prefix for ms edge (138) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image264.webp"
  alt="Use the -ms prefix."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And I didn't even talk about prefixes for the new Microsoft browser,
Edge. Right now, if a property is standard there will be no need for any
prefixes in Edge. If you are going to use experimental features, use the
-ms prefix.</p>

<h3>Using the prefixes</h3>

<p>Don't forget, you never know which version of a browser someone may
be using. Hopefully you want to share your work with as many people as
possible. Plan on your page working on a few iterations back of any
browser</p>

<h3>Code Together</h3>

<p>In the next section (2.6) I am going to walk you through some code. I
hope you will take the time to play with this code or make your own
version of the site. If you check the Resources tab you will find all of
the code I use in this course. If you would like to find a direct link

<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image265.webp" 
  alt="2.06. Code Together."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Welcome back, everybody. It's time for us to stop learning new things
and put into practice the things that we've been talking about in the
last week. What we're going to do is add some of the new components that
we've been working on. But we're going to do it together as we code
along, so again I'm going to stress that I really hope you stop, put
down whatever else you're doing, whip up your laptop or whatever you're
coding on, and code with me rather than just watching what I'm
doing.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 266. before and after menu (140) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image266.webp" 
  alt="Before and after menu."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When we last were coding together, hopefully you created something
that looks like this screen up here. We've gone in and we'd used width
and different displays, padding and margin and we were making our page a
little bit better.</p>
<p>Today, we're going to go a step further and add some different
elements such as gradient, instead of having three equal width sections
we're going to have some sections take up half the page, some take up
the full page, little things like this. And we're going to be utilizing
these new selectors that we've been studying. Let's begin.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 267. header/footer background (140) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image267.webp"
  alt="Header/Footer background."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The first thing that I want to do is put in that linear gradient or
that new color that goes in both the header and the footer. When I go to
my style sheet, and I'm going to come up here. One of the first things I
want to do is I want to put in that we need a new background for the
header and footer. I've started off by putting in a background color.
You always want to do that, because if you don't, if for some reason the
browser can't handle linear gradient, you've given it a fallback.</p>
<p>Then, I've had my linear gradient rule in each of the different
webkits. Once I add that and I hit save, we can refresh the page and see
if we have that kind of gray to blue color we were looking for. Hey,
great, we did. Now, when I wrote this rule, you might remember that I
put header, footer and that means it's supposed to apply to both of
these elements. But it only applied to the header. We need to think
about why that happened.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 268. footer background, #1 (141) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image268.webp" 
  alt="Footer background, #1."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The reason is if we scroll down, you can see that further down in the
page I have said, I want my footer background to be this particular
color. This overwrites any earlier rules, so I'm going to go in
here.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 269. footer background, #2 (141) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image269.webp" 
  alt="Footer background, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And I'm going to delete this, and say, let's get rid of that.
Refresh, and great. Now it looks much better. Okay, so we've made that
one change, and hopefully you're getting used to the idea of both using
the comma to style two elements at once, you can do even more and
putting in these web kit prefixes or browser prefixes. If you get rid of
it, it may work on your browser, but there's a really good chance it
won't work on the other browser. We want to practice this. All right,
let's take a look and see what we've got. I've got the gradient in.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 270. style links inside the nav (142) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image270.webp" 
  alt="Style the links inside the nav."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The next thing I want to tackle is styling these links, and again,
I'm not styling all the links in the page, because if you notice, this
one down here still looks exactly the same. I only want to style the
links that are inside the navigation section.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 271/272. style the nav (142) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"

<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image272.webp"
  alt="Style the nav."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>I'm going to go right here and, I've styled my nav. It looks good.
Next time, I'm going to say, hey, let's style just those links that are
inside the nav. And, we've made quite a few changes. If I come down
here, we can see it. One we've added something that looks like a box
structure to it. Normally you couldn't do this because in line elements
don't take a width and a height but, we'll go ahead and play with
it.</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and start, I'm going to first say I would like the
width of each one of my links to be about 22%, save this. Refresh, nope
no luck. So again, remember, one of the things I said is that links are
inline and you can't give them width or height. So now, if I go in and I
say let's change our display to inline-block, we should have much better
luck. Almost too much luck, because the screen doesn't quite fit that.
All right? All right. So great, that's one step closer.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 273/274. background colors (143) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"

  alt="After change of background color."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>Let's add that different background color. And I think I made it
white. But you can use anything you want. Boom. We're definitely getting
closer. Little tiny steps are getting us much, much closer.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 275/276. class definitions (143) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image275.webp"
  alt="Update class."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image276.webp"
  alt="Update class."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>The next thing I want to tackle as we try to change our page is this
idea that some of the sections should take up half the screen, while
some of the sections should go ahead and take up the whole width of the
screen. And the way we're going to do that is by using
<b>classes</b>.</p>
<p>If you remember, classes are a way to style certain groups of
elements in similar manners. Let's go ahead and see how we're going to
do this. The first thing I need to do is make a new class, and this
class is going to say, instead of all the sections taking up 30%, I want
just some of them, I'm going to call them half to take up about, let's
say 45% of the page. In this way it's only going to pick up some of the
sections, not all of them. If I refresh, it's not going to work yet
because the problem is I got rid of my section styling and replaced it
with this class and nowhere in my HTML did I remember to reference the
class.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 277/278. class='half' - width (144) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image277.webp"
  alt="Section with class='half' - two columns."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image278.webp"
  alt="After updating section with class='half'."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>For the first time we're now going to go into our HTML file and start
making some changes. Going to go here, I would like this one to only
take up half the screen, so I'll say class=half. And I would like this
one to take up half the screen. We've got that. We're not going to
change the other one, so when I refresh, you can see that two of them
are now next to each other. When I have and refreshed it looks a little
bit closer, other than I've got some weird things going on with some
blue and different things. This is because I've been using float. And if
you remember, when you're using float sometimes it causes things that
are next to each other to be basically in positions you don't want them
to be in. Our bottom section, the one that we knew we didn't want to be
floating, we need to go in and say hey, there's certain sections we want
to be whole.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 279/280. class='whole' (144) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image279.webp"
  alt="Section with class='whole' - take up whole width."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image280.webp"
  alt="Section with class='whole' - take up whole width."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>Let's go back to our style sheet. And I'm going to just do a little
bit of copy and paste here. And I'm going to say, you know what? This
one section, I need it to be class equals whole. So go back over here.
Section class = whole which means this one should take up the whole
width, don't try to float it next to each other. And let's go ahead and
refresh. That looks much better. It looks very much like we wanted
things to be at the end. And again, pay attention. Only the nav links
are styled, not all of the links.</p>
<p>We've put in the gradient. If your gradient isn't working, it might
be because you didn't put in your browser prefixes. We've really got a
lot of little things going on in this page. And again, I'm not a graphic
artist, so I don't make the most beautiful things. But it's kind of fun
to go in and create different things and see how you can style them
yourself. So, keep going and good luck and don't worry when you hit
those typos. We all do.</p>

<h2>Background Images and Opacity</h2>

<p>Earlier I briefly covered that the background property can take more
than just a color. Using background-images for your elements rather than
images is a great way to style your site, without adding the bulk of
more tags (and the necessary alt text). That said, using background
images can be challenging at first for two reasons: folder structure and
variations in image size.</p>

<h3>Folder structure</h3>

<p>As you code, it is recommended that your .html files be in one folder
and your css files and image files be in subfolders, something like
this:</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 281. css and images in subfolders (145) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image281.webp"
  alt="Creating 'css' and 'images' subfolders."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>But if your style sheet is trying to link to a picture called
"ocean.jpg" in your images folder, how can you link them together?</p>
<p>Neither of these first two options will work since there is no file
called ocean in the css folder, and the images folder isn't in there
either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>background-image: url('ocean.jpg')   </p>
<p>background-image: url('images/ocean.jpg')</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead, your code needs to tell the browser to "go up" one folder
and start looking from there. The "../" part of the code will do just
that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>background-image: url('.././images/ocean.jpg')</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Variations in image size</h3>

<p>Since it is rarely the case, the your image is just the perfect size
to fit in an element perfectly, there are additional background
properties you can play with to get your site looking just the way you
want them. These include, background-repeat, background-position, and
background-size (to name a few). You can use these properties to
position your image.</p>
<p>If this is something that you want to play with, I am going to direct
you to another Shay Howe tutorial, since that way you can use the
CodePen to actively change the options and see what happens.</p>
<p><a
href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/setting-backgrounds-and-gradients/">http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/setting-backgrounds-and-gradients/</a></p>

<h3>Opacity</h3>

<p>If you are using a background image and it is making it hard to read
the text, you can alter the opacity of the image. The opacity is how
transparent the image should appear. It is similar to the idea of using
rgb() colors and rgba() colors. (255,0,0) is red. (255,0,0, .5) is a
more transparent red.</p>

<h2 id="week2-07">2.07. Designing for Accessibility</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 282. designing for accessibility (146) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image282.webp"
  alt="2.07. Designing for Accessibility."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Hi, and welcome back as we go back and we talk about designing for
accessibility once again. As I've been telling you more and more cool,
neat things, I sometimes feel the need to rein you back in and remind
you of the basics of when you're designing your page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 283. overview: designing for accessibility (146) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image283.webp"
  alt="Overview: Designing for Accessibility."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>And part of that basics is that I want to remind you that the content
of your page should be in your HTML. What I mean by that is that it can
be really tempting to add content via colors, images, etc., things that
people may not be able to perceive, but you're not necessarily thinking
about it when, as a visual user, your kind of bringing it in.</p>
<p>What I want you to do as you're designing your pages and testing and
redesigning and testing and redesigning is remember what we call the
POUR guidelines. We want your pages to be perceivable, operable,
understandable, and robust. And the perceivable and understandable
really kind of match up with what you're doing with your CSS.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 284. perceivable (147) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image284.webp"
  alt="Perceivable."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>In order for things to be perceivable, I just want you to remember a
couple of things. First, always remember to provide text alternatives
for your images. Your images should not convey the information
completely on their own. Make sure that you're providing captions and
transcripts for video and audio. Now, not everyone has access to tools
to provide this for you for free, but where you work or where you go to
school may be able to help you out. Make sure you're using that correct
semantic markup so that content can be presented in different ways.</p>
<p>I want you using that nav tag. I want you using the figure tag
instead of the image tag. What tends to happen is that people have code
they've already written and they want to be a little bit lazy and not
have to change their HTML, because when they do, they have to change
their CSS. Go ahead and make that change. It's really going to be worth
it.</p>
<p>Make it easy for users to connect, to see their content, by using
really good color contrast. You'd be surprised to realize how many
people are unable to access information on the web because they really
can't see what you've put up there.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 285. operable (149) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image285.webp"
  alt="Operable."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Next, let's talk about what it means for your page to be operable.
What I mean by that is that all the functionality that's going into your
page should be available from the keyboard. Don't expect that everyone's
going to use a mouse to go over your page. Don't expect that some
things, it's okay for some things to only be accessible if you hover
over them.</p>
<p>Users should have the control over all the timing and the limits. If
you have those videos in media, make sure you're putting it in that
there's a control panel for them to turn things off, turn them down,
rewind, etc.</p>
<p>This is something that's actually important to me, because I have
family members who deal with this, is that you want to make sure that
you don't have some sort of content that flashes all the time. I'm not
talking about Flash the software. I'm talking about things that are
going to blink on the screen and the user doesn't have the control to
turn it off. This can actually cause seizures.</p>
<p>You want to provide ways to help users navigate through your page.
Don't make it a puzzle where they have to kind of figure out how to get
where they want to go. It's your job to make it as easy as possible for
them to find content and figure out where they are on your page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 286. ways to access the web (149) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image286.webp"
  alt="Different ways to access the web."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Here's just a few quick examples of different ways that people
sometimes access the web, whether it's with a penstick, a keyboard, a
remote, a kind of accessible keyboard, or even some sort of puff devices
that they can use to navigate through the web.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 287. understandable (150) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image287.webp"
  alt="Understandable."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Next, let's talk about what I mean when a page is understandable.
Typically, you want to keep your language short and sweet on your page.
Unless you're an author and you're showing off your works, people are
only going to spend a few seconds on your page. Make it easy for them to
understand what you're trying to say.</p>
<p>When you have text supplemented with illustrations, videos, and other
formats where appropriate, you want to make sure that you're using good
universal design, that people are able to access it.</p>
<p>Navigation, information structure, those should be really separate
and discernable from your content. Make people, make it easier for
people to get away, get back to certain pages, etc.</p>
<p>And next, make your pages operate in predictable ways. This can be
kind of a confusing thing to just talk about, but if you've ever been to
a website where you just can't quite figure out how to get back to the
page you were three pages ago, make it easy for people to get that.</p>
<p>Next, help users avoid and correct mistakes. It's up to you, not
them, to figure out how to access the information.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 288. robust (151) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image288.webp"
  alt="Is your web site robust?"
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Finally, the R, the robust in the POUR. Is your site functional
across various technologies, a smart phone, screen reader, laptop,
pensticks? As you work with me and we go further on, we'll talk about
responsive design in some later classes. And that's making sure that
your page looks the best it can look on different screen sizes. But it's
more than screen sizes, you also need to think about things like we
said, the pensticks and the screen readers.</p>
<p>There's going to be syntax errors that you might have in your code
that don't affect what the page looks like to you. You've gone in, it
looks great, you're like, I'm golden. You have to remember that those
syntax errors can mess up other technology.</p>
<p>Make sure that you're adhering to standards and to ensure future
compatibility with new browsers. And the easiest way to do that is to go
onto validator.w3c.org and the wave.webaim.org to validate your code.
It's simple, it's fast, and it's really going to give you a much better
page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 289. review (2.07.) (151) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image289.webp"
  alt="2.07. Review."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Just to review, I'm not asking you to make great strides. I just want
you to do little things right. And that really starts with the proper
HTML tags.</p>
<p>Styling can actually make it harder for some people to access the
information, so test, test, test. Have people look at your page. Have
them give you feedback. Don't take it personally. It's not about your
coding. It's about really making a great product.</p>
<p>Next, get into the early habit of utilizing these different
accessibility tools. They’re there for you to make your life easier, not
harder.</p>
<p>Finally, the one thing I really struggle with, with students, is we
all want to do the cool new things. But cool new styles and cool new
technologies should not be at the cost of accessibility and people
viewing your page.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that as you're learning this code and you're getting a
little bit stressed out about utilizing all these cool things you're
learning, that you're remembering it's not about having the coolest
webpage. It's about having a clean page that really portrays the
information you want to get out on the web. Good luck.</p>

<h3>The importance of headings</h3>

<p>Prior to HTML5 it was a given that each page should have at most one
h1 heading. However, when HTML5 introduced the many semantic container
elements (section, article, main, aside, ...) the role of the h1changed.
The article linked here makes some excellent points on how using more
than one &lt;h1&gt; tag can increase the search engine performance of
your page, as well as enhance accessibility:</p>

<h2>Homework Two Description</h2>

<p>This homework is also described in a video lecture. Make sure to watch it to get a 
better feel for what I am looking for.</p>

<h3>Objectives:</h3>

<ol type="1">
  <li>Create a style sheet and link it to the html files. (Without changing the html.)</li>
  <li>Style the sheet using the properties we covered in lecture.</li>
  <li>Consider using some elements we didn’t cover, or didn’t cover well. You 
    can search for the options online, or you can watch the videos from Week Four 
	for some pointers.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Background:</h3>

<p>I assume that you have finished all of the Week Two lecture videos,
and you may want to watch Week Three as you complete this assignment.
This assignment builds on Assignment One, but we have a new set of
“After” pictures. You can see the newly styled pages 
<a href="http://intro-webdesign.com/CSS/assignment-2/index.jpg">here:</a> and 
<a href="http://www.intro-webdesign.com/CSS/assignment-2/teams.jpg">here</a> and, finally 
<a href="http://www.intro-webdesign.com/CSS/assignment-2/history.jpg">here</a></p>

<h3>Getting started:</h3>

<p>You will use the same code as you used for Assignment One. I would
recommend that you save a copy of your stylesheet for backup. The html
is all still the same.</p>

<h3>Steps:</h3>

<ol type="1">
  <li>Download the image from <a href="http://intro-webdesign.com/CSS/assignment-2/./images/flywheel.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    http://intro-webdesign.com/CSS/assignment-2/./images/flywheel.jpg</a>and put 
	it into a folder named images.</li>
  <li>Style the following:
  <ul>
    <li>The body should have padding and margin</li>
    <li>The header should have a background color, background image (using a local 
      image), and padding</li>
    <li>The navigation links (and only the links in the navigation) should be 
      styled with a new display, margin, border-radius, text-decoration, and padding</li>
    <li>The link to the current page should be styled differently from the other 
      links (using class = "active')</li>
    <li>The sections should be next to each other, not one on top of the other.</li>
    <li>The images should be part of the page now. In addition, they should have 
      a border, be centered horizontally, and have vertical (top/bottom) space between 
	  them and the other images.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em><b>I have included a video you can watch to see a live demo
of this new site. You can watch it in the next video, or link directly
<a href="a
href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introcss/lecture/VQgU9/02-08-optional-homework-description">here.</a></b></em></p>

<h2>Submission</h2>

<ol type="1">
  <li>Submit your css file, we will still call it hw1.css.</li>
  <li>Use the peer grader to assess the work of your fellow students. This second 
    assignment may have a number of different options. You can grade the assignment 
	by eye, or else save the css and try applying it to the html files.</li>

  style="width:40%" />

<p>Hi, everybody. Welcome back, it's time for another homework example.
What we're going to be doing this week is adding even more style to the
pages that you started styling last week.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 294. objective (156) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image294.webp"
  alt="Objective."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The objective of this assignment is that I don't want you to be
changing the html at all. I want you to either create a new style sheet
or update last week's style sheet so it can be used on three different
html files.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 295. getting started (157) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image295.webp"
  alt="Getting Started."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When you get started it's very important that you've completed the
first peer graded assignment. I'm going to assume that you have it done
and so when I talk in this video about the different changes, I want you
to make. You can either alter that previous homework assignment, or you
really can start completely from scratch if you weren't happy with your
earlier work.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 296/297. before/after ultimate frisbee history (157) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"

  alt="After, Ultimate Frisbee History."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>Let's take a look at the before and after for this assignment that I
want you to try to achieve. This was our page when we first started. In
homework one, you took it from here to here. Still very simple, but just
much cleaner because we added some background color, some color fonts,
and we got rid of those images.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 298. styling the menu (158) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image298.webp"
  alt="Styling the Menu."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What I want you to work on this week is really changing things and
making it really styled as opposed to just clean. Let's take a look at
what I'd like you to work on in week three. As you can see this looks
like a completely different site. The images are back in, I've added a
background image for a navigation bar and something that isn't
necessarily easy to see when you're just looking at paper, I've added a
new class that highlights which page we're on right now. If you look,
the home link is highlighted because we're on the home page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 299. which menu option (158) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image299.webp"
  alt="Which Menu Option is Highlighted?"
  style="width:40%" />

<p>If I click on history, the history link is how that it because we're
on the history page and then the same way, the team's page. This is what
we call the current page that we're looking at. You're going to be
styling this to let your viewers know where they are on this page. I'm
going to go through and talk about each of the tags I want you to look
at in order to complete this assignment.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 300. leave the html alone (159) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image300.webp"
  alt="."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When you get started, you're going to leave that HTML code alone, and
you're either going create a new style sheet, or you're going to go
ahead and update the one you used before.</p>
<p>What you're going to need to work on specifically are these elements.
You need to work on the body, the header, the h one, the links, and then
I have three classes called active, left, and right, and finally, you're
going to want to put those images back in that were in the left-hand
side of the page.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 301. body (159) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image301.webp"
  alt="Body of menu."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>First, let's talk about the body. By default, your browsers put in
some sort of padding and margin, but I want you to overwrite that and
put something that will look consistent across all browsers. You can
also feel free to adjust the size of the text, but that's not required.
I know I did because I just found the text a little bit too small.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 302. header of menu (160) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image302.webp"
  alt="Header of menu."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Next, go to the header. The first step is to change the background
color and see if you can get that to work. Next, you're going to want to
add a background image. And to be honest, this will be the trickiest
part of the whole homework assignment. Because sometimes it's not always
clear where you can find the images and where you can't, so make sure
you check in some of the other resources if you get stuck on this
part.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 303. h1 of menu (160) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image303.webp"
  alt="h1 of menu."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Next, I want you to change the font color and increase that font size
a little bit more. Now here again is something that's new that you
didn't learn before. I want you to style the links that are in the
navigation section but only those links. Not all the links in the
page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 304. navigation links of menu (161) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image304.webp"
  alt="Navigation links of menu."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>You don't need to recreate my example exactly, but I do want your
links to be nicely spaced apart, they should have some background color,
rounded borders and no underline. Make them look nice.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 305. active class (161) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image305.webp"
  alt="Active class."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Next make sure you saw that active class I talked about. That's how
people will be able to know which page they're looking at without having
to look at the URL.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 306. left and right class (161) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image306.webp"
  alt="Left and Right Class."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Now another thing that you’re going to need to work on is this idea
that our page has a left and a right class to it. Now in order to get
things to go next to each other you’re going to need to mess with the
display and possibly float depending on how you implement this. Make
sure you change them so that they're side by side, and change that
background color for the left class. You may have already done that in
the previous homework, but if you didn't make sure it gets done now.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 307. images (162) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image307.webp"
  alt="Images."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Finally, we want to get back to those images. First, you need to put
the images back in because, hopefully in homework one, you set their
display to none, which means they're gone. Put them back into something
so that they'll stack up on top of each other.</p>
<p>Next, make sure that they're centered within that left class. I don't
want the pictures to be all the way to one side or the other. And, while
you're centering them, make sure you put some space between them, on the
top and bottom, too.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 308. peer grading (162) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image308.webp"
  alt="Peer Grading."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Once again, we'll be using the peer grader to evaluate your work.
Unlike before, grades will be based on level of completion, and somewhat
more of how your page looks. We want to make sure that you're not
putting things that are hard to read or that are really kind of squished
together.</p>
<p>If you get the chance, make sure you run your page through some
different accessibility evaluators. There was wave and there's webbing.
There are different places you can go. But this is the really nice part
about peer grading, your peers can tell you whether or not things don't
really have the best color contrast. Now again, proper standards are
going to apply. And this is particularly important when we start talking
about advanced selectors. I found that sometimes people throw everything
they can possibly think of into their style sheet, and they just hope,
hope, hope that it works. We are going to take points off if you try to
do that.</p>
<p>Now the final thing I do want to mention is that I know that people
are coding on different devices. When you submit your code, make sure to
feel free to say my code only really looks good on a big screen, or on a
phone, or something like that. Taking care of different screen sizes is
something called responsive design that we don't handle in this
particular course. I don't expect you to make a site that looks great on
every platform.</p>
<p>What I do expect you to do is really own the code that you submit
this time. Make sure you know exactly what each line is doing and feel
comfortable changing little parts and feeling like your page won't
break. Again, if you run into problems, make sure you hit those
discussion boards. You have classmates have been really helpful, and I
really want to encourage that communication. Good luck.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 309. pseudo classes and elements (3.01) (164) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image309.webp"
  alt="Pseudo Classes and Elements."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Welcome back everybody. Today we're going to talk very briefly about
pseudo classes and elements. We've been working with different types of
elements throughout this entire course, and how we can structure them
and style them.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 310. types of pseudo-classes (165) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image310.webp"
  alt="Types of Pseudo-Classes; link, visited, hover, active, focus, enabled, checked, 
    &amp; disabled."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Well, pseudo elements are kind of different from the other things
we've seen before in that they are very dependent on the DOM structure,
and some of them are actually dynamically populated. To be honest, you
have seen this before back when we talked about styling links because
the links had those different states. One example we used was the idea
of hover. If you hover a link, you can change the style to get rid of
maybe the underline or change the color. Let's talk about some of these
different types of pseudo-classes beyond what you can do with just a
link.</p>
<p>I started off with the one we've seen before. You can have a link and
also a link that's been visited. You can also react to different user
actions. If someone's hovering over a paragraph or hovering over an H1
tag, you can still react to it. It doesn't just have to be a link. You
can also have active, and active is when you're holding the mouse button
down over some sort of element.</p>
<p>And the last one is focus. Focus would be when someone's tabbing
through the page you can put focus down on each one of these.</p>
<p>Finally, one that makes a lot of sense and you've probably seen
before is that you can dial the pseudo-classes of forms or interfaces.
If the check box has been clicked or checked off, you can see that
sometimes they make it yellow. Or if you've ever been to a site and
you're not allowed to type something in until you type something in a
box above, higher in, they tend to gray it out. The way you would do
this is you could say, you know what? If someone hovers over my
paragraph, I want to just do a border. Border:1 px. Now, even though
there's no place on the DOM where they have p:hover, it should work for
you when you put that styling rule in.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 311. types of pseudo-classes; structural/positional (166) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image311.webp"
  alt="Types of Pseudo-Classes; structural/positional; first-check, last-child 
    nth-child, only-child, first-of-type, last-of-type, only-of-type."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>You can also style based on the structural position of the different
elements. You have first-child, last-child, nth-child. The way that one
works is you put a number in to say the fifth child or the tenth child.
You can have only child. You also have other different things such as
first-of-type, last-of-type, only-of-type. And again, you just have the
element, the colon, and then the name of the pseudo-class that you want
to style. Pseudo elements aren't necessarily part of the DOM, but they
can be used to style specific or unique parts of the page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~ 312. types of pseudo-classes; textual, positional, fragments (166) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image312.webp"
  alt="Types of Pseudo-Classes; Textual, Positional/Generated, Fragments; first-
    letter, fist-line, before, after, &amp; selection."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Some examples might if you have a paragraph and you want to put in
that fancy first letter with a different font, you can use the first
letter pseudo element. Same with the first line, you can generate things
to show up before or after elements. A lot of times if you're styling
something like credit card information, you can go ahead and put in the
different types of credit cards but have a little before that says, and
hey, put a picture in here. You can also style just fragments of
different selections.</p>

  alt="3.01. Review; Pseudo-Classes and Elements."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Now I didn't give you much code when we went through here because
really using pseudo classes and pseudo elements is very unique to the
page you're going to make. So later when we talk about tables, keep an
eye out because I'm going to be using a lot of pseudo classes and pseudo
elements there. It's really important to realize that I'm not going to
be able to cover every combination of everything we learn about. But I
do want to give you the tools so that you can go out and investigate how
you can add some cool new styles to your page. Good luck.</p>

<h2 id="week3-02">3.02. Transitions</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 314. transitions (3.02) (167) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image314.webp"
  alt="3.02. Transitions"
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Hi, everybody. In this lecture we're going to talk about transitions.
You've seen in different examples that we can change the state of
elements. Links can go from regular link to visited. You can hover over
things. You can focus them.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 315. transitions (168) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image315.webp"
  alt="Transitions."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Well, what if you want to actually have a little bit of almost
animation when you do these things? That's what we can use transitions
for. If you hover over the link, you can change the color. If an image
comes into focus, meaning you've tabbed into it, you can change the
size. And it's just these little tiny things that sometimes, when you're
making your page, gives you that little bit of cool factor that you've
been looking for, to show that you're really starting to grasp these
concepts.</p>
<p>Let's get started. If you want to add transitions to your page,
there's four properties that you're going to want to look at.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 316. the properties (168) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image316.webp"
  alt="The properties."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The first is the actual transition property. What is it that you want
to change? Do you want to change the size, the color, the position, all
of them?</p>
<p>What about the transition duration? How long should each transition
last? They can happen very quickly, where people almost don't even
notice it, or it can be really long and drawn out.</p>
<p>The transition timing is, it's a little bit odd, but it's this idea
of, if you're going to make something bigger, do you want to make it
slowly bigger and linear all at the same time or do you want it to ease
in or ease out? You can actually change how, kind of what speed it's
doing the different things.</p>
<p>Transition delay is, do you want me to wait, should the browser wait
before it starts to transition? If somebody's hovering, do you want them
to hover for two seconds before you go on?</p>
<p>You might want to think about this, because sometimes when people are
looking at your page, they've got, just got the mouse going all over.
And you don't want to have them looking at the transitions unless they
really need to be focusing in on that one element.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 317. setting up (169) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image317.webp"
  alt="Setting Up."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>All right. Let's go ahead and get started. If you want to use
transitions, the first thing you need to do is just what you've been
doing all along, define your element and say what style you want it to
have when you first load the page.</p>
<p>Next, you want to choose which elements you want to transition. You
may have styled it with background color, color, width, and height. You
don't necessarily want to change all of those things when you go into
your transition. Pick the ones that you do want to change.</p>
<p>Third, define the new values for those elements. And this is
important. You need to combine this step with a pseudo-class. It needs
to be along with a hover or a focus or an active.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 318. steps, #1 (169) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image318.webp"
  alt="Steps, #1."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's look at some code just on the screen, and then I'll run you
through an actual example. Here, I've went ahead and defined a div to
just have color, background, line height, width height, all the typical
things. If you notice, the border radius is pretty small. It's only six
pixels.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 319. steps, #2 (170) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image319.webp"
  alt="Steps, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Next, I went in and I said, you know what, I'm going to go ahead and
define each one of these properties. My properties I want to change are
going to be color, width, background, and border radius. This is a lot,
but I wanted a big example. You can say, I want it to take half a
second, I want it to all be pretty much the same change, and I want you
to wait a half a second before you start that transition.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 320. steps, #3 (170) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image320.webp"
  alt="Steps, #3."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The last step, the one that had to do with the pseudo-class, was
adding the <em>div:hover</em> and giving the new values that I want everything to
be. So instead of being black, I want to switch it to white. Instead of
the width being 250 pixels, I want it to be 350, different background
color, and a much bigger border radius. All right?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 321. css changes made (171) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image321.webp"
  alt="CSS changes made."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's go ahead and look at an example that I have. I already coded up
to show you. In this example I've used an internal style sheet, partly
because the entire bulk of my HTML is right down here. All I have is one
div. How I've styled it is to say that for now on when someone hovers
over this div, I want you to change the color with background and border
radius. And I've also put in active, just because I wanted to show you
that you can do multiple different states. Active, if you've, maybe
don't recall, is when you're clicking down on a state.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 322. hover and transition (171) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image322.webp"
  alt="Hover and transition."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's take a look. Here's my transition, just by default, when you're
looking at the page. Now, when I mouse over it, you can see that it's
kind of this cool change of color and border radius. Border radius
actually can change things from looking like a square to looking like a
circle.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 323. hover, state active (172) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image323.webp"
  alt="Hover, state active."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The final one is now I'm going to hold the mouse down and we're going
to see what happens when the state goes into active. You can see, once
again, I've changed all those things. I actually think this is pretty
cool. It can also, however, be very distracting. So, you want to use
transitions sparingly to make sure you're not taking away things from
your page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 324. using shorthands (172) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image324.webp"
  alt="Using shorthands."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>It is possible and very common to use shorthand when you're writing
out your different transitions. Instead of writing transition duration,
properties, different things like that, you can put it all in one line.
This one is saying I want to change the background, it should take .2
seconds, and I want to ease out or I want it to be a linear transition.
Here, it's saying I want to go ahead and change the border radius, how
long it should take, the type of transition, and how long you want to
delay. When you look at other people's code, don't be confused if it
doesn't look like my first example. They've probably been using the
shortcuts.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 325. review (3.02. transitions) (173) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image325.webp"
  alt="3.02. Review Transitions."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>All right. So hopefully that was a little bit cool and you're excited
to go and implement some sort of transitions on your page. Playing with
them will also do more than make your site look kind of colorful and
active. It's going to give you practice on understanding these different
pseudo-classes and states such as active, focus, hover, etc.</p>
<p>But please remember that accessibility is always going to be an issue
when you're dealing with different states on page. Don't require that
people are going to hover on your page. Don't require that people are
going to tab through. You want to make sure that all your content is
always available, and just keep those transitions for something a little
bit extra to add to your site. Good luck.</p>

<h2 id="week3-03">3.03. Transforms</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 326. transforms (3.03.) (173) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image326.webp"
  alt="3.03. Transforms."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Hello everyone. Today we're going to talk briefly about transforms.
Transforms are very similar to transitions; in that they provide another
option for changing the appearance of elements that are on our page. We
can change things in both the two-dimensional manner and a
three-dimensional manner as people are looking at your site.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 327. 2d transform options (174) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image327.webp"
  alt="2d Transform Options."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's look at some of the two-dimensional transform options. We're
going to talk about translate, rotate, scale, skew and matrix, and how
each one of these can work within your CSS3.</p>
<p>The first option I'm going to show you is translate. What translate
will do is that you can give it two values, I've called them x and y and
depending on those values, you can move the element to the left and
right or up and down. If x is positive, you move off to the right, if
it's negative you move to the left. With y, if it's positive you move
down and if it's negative you move up. Let's look at an actual example
to make it a little bit clearer.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 328. translate, #1 (174) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image328.webp"
  alt="Translate, #1."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Here, I've got this nice blue element. And what I'm about to say is
that I want to translate it, 100 and 75. So you're going to expect to
see it move off to the right and down a little bit.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 329. translate, #2 (175) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image329.webp"
  alt="Translate, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>You can see, again, it's hard to really tell when things go up and
down. But if you look at the margins, we've almost effectively increased
the margins. The next option is rotate. When you rotate something, you
are rotating, or I kind of like to think of it as spinning the element,
a certain number of degrees. You don't see the spin. You just see the
result or what it would look like at the end.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 330. rotate, #1 (175) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image330.webp"
  alt="Rotate, #1."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Here I have another element and I'm going to tell it to rotate by 30 degrees.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 331. rotate, #2 (175) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image331.webp"
  alt="Rotate, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>From here, to here. Now it's really important that remember to put
the deg. If you just put 30, many of the browsers are not going to have
that work. In fact, most of them won't. Make sure you give it the
degrees you want it to turn, some sort of number, 30, 90, 80, and then
use degree.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 332. scale (176) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image332.webp"
  alt="Scale."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Next, let's talk about scale. And scale is just a fancy way of
saying, let's make it wider or taller. Again, you give it two numbers,
and that's how much you want to change the width and the height of an
element. Here I have a smaller block, and I've decided I'd like to make
it two times as wide and three times as high. Here's a new element after
the transform scale.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 333. skew, #1 (176) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image333.webp"
  alt="Skew, #1."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Skew is very hard for me to explain what it does, and it's even
harder to do it because I always forget my left and rights when I'm
looking at the camera. Again, you're going to want to play with this one
and look at some of the examples. What you're doing is you're rotating
the element a certain number of degrees around the x angle and a certain
number of degrees around the y angle. Here I'm going to show you a skew,
30 degrees by 15 degrees.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 334. skew, #2 (177) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image334.webp"
  alt="Skew, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>You start off here and you end up kind of turned at a very kind of
weird angle. And it's very hard to show you this when I'm staring at the
screen, so I'm hoping you'll type that in and kind of play with it a
little bit.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 335. matrix - combine 2d transform methods (177) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image335.webp"
  alt="Matrix - Combine 2d transform methods."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The next and final option is matrix. And when you use the matrix, you
can combine all of the 2D transform methods into one command at once. I
never use this, because I find it far too confusing to remember which
one's scale, which one's rotate, which one's skew. Unless you feel
really confident with your CSS3, I would avoid using matrix and go ahead
and use each of the other individual transforms one at a time.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 336. 3d rotate (177) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image336.webp"
  alt="3d Rotate."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The other ones that we just talked about were two dimensional
transforms. We can also do three dimensional transforms, and they're
very similar to ones we just talked about. For instance, with rotate,
now instead of just rotating along the x or y axis, we can also rotate
around the z dimension as well. If you wanted to use a 3D rotate, your
options now are transform:rotateY how many degrees, rotateX, rotateZ, or
you can actually say rotate3d and give it numbers along every single
dimension.</p>
<p>I rarely use the 3D dimensions. But we do have the options. We have
the rotate, we have the scale, and we have the translate. And they can
really do some really interesting things with how you want your elements
to look. When it comes time to use transforms, there's a few things to
think about.</p>

<p>Typically, when you use transforms, you're going to use them with state changes. If 
you remember, that means you might have a transform happen when you do an on hover, or 
an on focus, or an on active. If you're really just trying to change what an element 
looks like right from the start and leave it that way, you may want to think about just
taking pictures and messing with the pictures and doing things offline. It's faster and 
it doesn't use up as much bandwidth. However, it's a cool way to kind of play with 
things and gain confidence with your CSS. Of course, with so many things we've been 
learning in this class, it's important to remember that you'll often require browser 
prefixes to get transforms to work.</p>
<p>One more tool in your tool belt for learning how to do something exciting with your 
page. I know that I didn't do my normal example here, but the next video is going to 
show an example using transitions, transforms, and some of the other things we've been 
learning all along. I hope you'll take a look at it and feel a little more confident 
about what we just learned with transforms. Good luck.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 338. code together - transitions (3.04) (179) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image338.webp"
  alt="3.04. Code Together - Transitions."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>In the past, we've done code together segments, where I've coded,
you've coded along with me, and we've made lots of little mistakes
together. Today, I really want to do a code review instead. I want you
to sit back and look at some of the code that I've written and see how
the little things that we've been learning are adding up together to
create more complex webpages.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 339. new divs, a thru h - 8 (179) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image339.webp"
  alt="Add 8 new divs, A thru H."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's start with some HTML. Over here, I have code that's just going
to create a bunch of different divs. The one thing that might be new
that you haven't seen before is this idea of tab index. What the tab
index does is it lets the browser know that if somebody is tabbing
through your page, you actually want to put different elements in focus
in a different order.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 340. tab index new divs (180) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image340.webp"
  alt="Tab Index New Divs."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>In this case, the first thing would be A, and then C, and then B,
etc. It's just one more level of accessibility that I wanted to
introduce to you in our code. The only other thing I wanted you to know
in this HTML is that the very last div has a class animate in it. I've
made this one a little bit different so that you can look at transitions
and transforms in action.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 341. transition two seconds ease (180) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image341.webp"
  alt="Add transition 2 seconds ease."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's look at the CSS, and play with the browser. Now, when we start
at the top, you can see that I've just dialed the div so that they're
little boxes where you can see the contents, and it's not all too
squished together. The one thing that you may not have used yet yourself
in your code is this idea of transition two second’s ease. This is going
to let the browser know that when we change states, we want to take
about two seconds and ease it in. But first, let's look at the
focus.</p>
<p>In my focus, I say change the background color. So now, when I go to
my browser, I'm going to start tabbing through the different elements.
And when I do, you can see that they all light up. I'm going to refresh
the page, because the one that I expected to go first didn't. That's
because I'd been tabbing before we even started typing.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 342. color change with focus (181) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image342.webp"
  alt="Change background color with focus."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>So here we go. ‘A’ changes color, and then C, and then B. This is you
giving the user power to jump to the most important sections first. All
right, so after focus, let's talk about hover. Now when hover comes into
case, what I'm saying is make the width 200 pixels, it was 100, and
change the background color.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 343. highlight smooth transition (181) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image343.webp"
  alt="Highlight Smooth Transition."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's take a look. I'm going to highlight over C right here, and then
B, and then A. And you can see it's a very nice, smooth transition. But
one of the things I do want you to notice is that when I'm not hovering
over anything, we actually have A through F on the top line and then G
through I on the bottom. When you start to go a little bit too crazy
changing the size of things dynamically, you can throw everything off
position. So, make sure you use this sparingly.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 344. div with animate class (182) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image344.webp"
  alt="Add div with animate class."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>All right, let's get to the cool one, the last one. If you remember,
I made one div, and I set it to be animated because I used the animate
class. Right now, the only difference is the background color is a
little bit green, but I want to show you what happens when I hover over
it. When I do, I'm going to kick off a transform where I'm going to say
rotate this 360 degrees. And in addition, instead of having an opacity
of 0.4, which means kind of blur it out, clear it out a little bit, set
it to the full color. Here we go. I think that's pretty cool. We rotated
it. When we go off the hover, it rotates back. These are the kind of fun
things that you can add to your page when you're first learning how to
code that really give you this sense of, hey, I'm doing it, I'm making
things change.</p>
<p>What I'd really encourage you to do now is go back, review the
transition lecture, review the transform lecture, make sure and see if
those concepts now make a little bit more sense that you've seen the
code in action. And I hope you'll play with this code, change the
values, and really have some fun with it. So good luck.</p>

<h2>Positioning</h2>

<p>I think we have all encountered those annoying pop-up Internet ads
that just won't seem to go away. This week you will learn how to make
your very own version of those annoying ads. Using the box model
principals, you learned earlier, you will learn to manipulate the
positioning property.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2 id="week3-05">3.05. Positioning</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 345. positioning (3.05) (183) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image345.webp"
  alt="3.05 Positioning."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Hi everybody, welcome back. Today, we're going to be talking about
positioning elements in your webpage. So, trying to layout your page and
your coding is probably going to be one of the most time consuming and,
potentially, frustrating things that you're going to do in this entire
course. And that's one reason why I've left almost this entire week for
us to practice laying things out on your page. The ideas themselves are
very simple and straightforward, but it's the putting them together, as
you add more and more to your page, where things can get a little bit
tricky. Let's begin talking about the different positioning elements,
or, the different positioning properties, that you can use, okay?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 346. position properties (183) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image346.webp"
  alt="Position Properties."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The four position properties are static, relative, absolute, and
fixed, and for the most part they're very different. How they work
together, or how they work, is that each one of these can also be
modified by properties such as top, right, bottom, and left. So, you say
what kind of position you want the element to be, and then you can say,
but I want it to be this far from the top or this high off the bottom,
or this far over from the left.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 347. static, #1 (184) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image347.webp"
  alt="Static, #1."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's start with static, and the reason we're going to start with
static is because you've already been using it all along. It's what we
call the default value for elements. If you don't say anything else,
it's going to be set to this.</p>
<p>How it works is that the browser is going to place each element in
just the next available position. You can give it values such as top,
bottom, left, and right, but the browser's going to completely ignore
it. How it's going to work is something like this.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 348. static, #2 (184) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image348.webp"
  alt="Static, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let me see if I can draw this up here. Is you've got your screen. And
then it's time to start adding things to your page, and the browser
goes, oh, well this is span so it fits right here. And the next one's
span, so it fits right here. Oh, she's got something that's block, so I
need to go down here. So, as you add, it just starts at the top, and
works its way across, and then down.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 349. relative, #1 (185) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image349.webp"
  alt="Relative, #1."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>But we can go beyond that. We can change how the browser positions
things, and one of the ways we can do that is to use position relative.
And when I say relative, I mean relative to itself. Where would it
go?</p>
<p>All right, let's scooch it over a little bit. It's, basically, very
similar to the static position, but now you get to add these offsets.
The new positioning, the new place that we put the element, it's not
going to affect any of its neighbors. Instead, what it may do is leave
holes where the browser thought it should've been in the first
place.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 350. relative, #2 (185) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image350.webp"
  alt="Relative, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Usually, relatively positioned elements are used as containers or
blocks for other elements. So let me just show you another quick example
here. Turn this on. I've got my browser window, and let's say I'm about
to put in a span element, and it's going to go right there. Well
instead, if you say that the position is relative, and you give it some
sort of number like top ten, instead of placing it right here, it's
actually going to go underneath where it should be.</p>
<p>So again, we're just adding little numbers to move things from where
they would normally go.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 351. absolute, #1 (186) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image351.webp"
  alt="Absolute, #1."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The next position is what we call absolute. And this one can really
confuse people when you first start it, because the browser, instead of
putting it in the next available position, it ignores all the elements,
and really just looks at the main container it was in. In this case,
we're going to show one example with the browser. The other elements on
the page behave as if it doesn't even exist. And what this can lead to,
is that you can end up with one element on top of another.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 352. absolute, #2 (186) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image352.webp"
  alt="Absolute, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's try this. I've got my browser. Don't have a lot of room, here.
So right here. And let's say I've got a div, and I've decided that it's
absolute, and it should be a 100 down from the top, and maybe a 100
over. It goes right here. All right, well, if we were doing relative,
the next element would go underneath it. But if we have two absolute
values, the next one that shows up is going to go, again, right on top
of it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 353. fixed position (187) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image353.webp"
  alt="Fixed Position."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>All right, the final position that I'm going to talk about is called
fixed. And the fixed position is relative to the browser window. This is
how they're able to create these pages, where sometimes you get that pop
up, and you just can't get it to go away. You keep scrolling and
scrolling, and it's following you.</p>
<p>Well, how they've done that is they've used that fixed position. That
element is not going to move even if the window is scrolled. Just so you
know if you're using some older browser, or you're trying to design for
Internet Explorer 7 or 8, this only works if you're using an HTML5
DOCTYPE.</p>
<p>So again, when you think of the fixed position think of pop-up boxes
that just won't go away. Or you might want to also think of it as
something more useful which is when you're on a page, and you might have
that navigation bar that's on the top, and as you scroll through the
page, you don't have to scroll back up to see the navigation bar,
because it's always just there.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 354. position properties (187) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image354.webp"
  alt="Elements and their position properties."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's go ahead and look at an example where I've got some different
elements that use the different position properties. Okay, I'm about to
show you a page where I've gone in, and I've put a couple elements. Just
two divs, and a couple paragraphs. And just to start off, I gave them
some starter styling, just so we can distinguish between them.</p>
<p>For our div, I position relative, I gave it a height, a width, and a
border. For the paragraphs, I gave it a border of a different color,
gave it a top and left, and I left it as position static, because that's
the default position it would always be. I want to show you what that's
going to look like over in the browser.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 355. two divs (a and b) and a paragraph c (188) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image355.webp"
  alt="Two divs on top (a and b) and a third paragraph below (c)."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>If you look, you can see I've got two divs, one up here and down
here, and I have my three paragraphs. One, two, three.</p>
<p>The first thing I want to point out is that this doesn't look exactly
the way some of you may expect it to look, or even exactly the same way
some of you might see it if you load it on your browser. Instead of
putting this paragraph all the way at the top, it's actually pushed down
a little bit. Same for the B and the C. The reason that happens is
because all the browsers have different default values for where the
paragraph should be positioned.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 356. webkit with inspect (188) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image356.webp"
  alt="webkit with Inspect."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let me scroll over here for a second. I'm going to go down. And you
can see that there's this weird code right here that says, -webkit-
margin-before and -webkit-margin-after. This is an example of some
pseudo classes that they used.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 357. a, b, and c relative (189) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image357.webp"
  alt="A, B, and C all relative."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>I don't want these different default things to be coming into play.
I'm going to get rid of them. After I comment those out and comment that
back in, I refresh, and now we've got our A, B and C. So again, A, B,
and C, are all relative. You're telling the browser, just put it in the
next available space.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 358. static and relative element (189) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image358.webp"
  alt="Static and Relative Elements."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's see what's going to happen now if I change my element from
relative to static, or from static to relative. And you can see that
they've moved over, and the reason they moved over is that I gave it the
values of top 100 and left 100. Go down, push on over. If I change this
to 59. You can see doesn't move over quite as much. So, static just go
in the first place you can. Relative, go in the first place you can, but
go ahead, you can tell it if you want it to move over a little bit in
either direction.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 359. stacked a and b (190) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image359.webp"
  alt="Rectangles A and B stacked."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The next one that we're going to do is absolute. Maybe. There we go,
so now I want you to notice something. That A and that B, they're on top
of each other. Because you said, I want you to be 100 pixels down and 59
pixels off from the side of the container element. In this case, it's
that div. This is odd because they're right on top of each other, and
it's all mixed together.</p>
<p>There are circumstances where you will want things to be on top of
each other. Maybe one of them will be visible, and one of them will be
hidden, and they're going to change dynamically. But this is what
happens with absolute.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 360. static, relative, absolute and fixed (190) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image360.webp"
  alt="Position: fixed so can't scroll away."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Now, if I scroll, I'm going to make this screen a little bit smaller,
and I scroll, you can see that the A and the B, they do scroll away.
And, of course, I did this example because I wanted to show you that if
I switched this to fixed now, instead of saying position the element
relative to its parent, saying position this element relative to the
entire browser.</p>
<p>Now everything's on top of each other, and if I try to scroll away.
It doesn't work. It stays right there, okay? So again, it's static,
relative, absolute, and fixed. And I want you to play with these, and
know your options, before you start laying out your code by hand.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 361. z-index (191) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image361.webp"
  alt="z-index."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Now, one of the things I showed you is that it's possible for multiple elements 
to be placed in the same position or on top of each other. And there's a way to 
deal with that if you don't like the ordering that they're showing up. And that's 
called the Z-index.</p>
<p>The Z-index is just, basically, just a number value, it's either positive or 
negative, that tells the browser your stacking order. If you have something and 
you're really sure you want to make sure it's always on top, you'd go ahead and 
put something like 100 on it. If you didn't really care, you'd could give it a 
negative 100. And this is the way that people can go ahead, and position the elements 
to be a little bit more dynamic later on, when we add some JavaScript or different 
things like that.</p>
<p>The Z-index is something that not a lot of people code with, but it's really 
helpful when you're using inspect element, if there's something below, and you 
want to see what it looks like on top.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 362. review (3.05 positioning) (191) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image362.webp"
  alt="3.05 Review - Positioning."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's go ahead and review. Positioning your element is the key to creating the 
layouts that you want to have. And this is especially important if you're worried 
about your site looking good on a small screen, a big screen, etc. Proper planning 
is going to make this much easier for you when it comes time to code up your page.</p>

<p>But really, the most important thing you can do right now is go online, find 
those tutorials or different references where they talk about positioning, and play 
with it until you're feeling a little bit more comfortable with how each of these 
work. Good luck.</p>

<p>In today's code review, we're going to talk about making a calendar.
Because what I really like about calendars is that there are all these
little, tiny things you need to think about to really make your page
look professional.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 364. plain calendar (193) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image364.webp"
  alt="Plain Calendar."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What I have right here on the screen is a very, very plain calendar,
where you can see, I have all the days in the month. I also have, on
some days, little appointments. I'm going to have lunch with mom, or
meet with the dean, or be library helper. And, on the 31st, it's
Halloween, so boo! What can we do to take this information, this content
from our HTML5, and turn it into something that's really pleasing?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 365. calendar with style, #1 (194) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image365.webp"
  alt="Calendar with Style, #1."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Well let's take a look at what I've done with it. Here, I've used CSS
to create a calendar that has a lot of different things going on it.</p>
<p>First, I've styled it nicely. I've included things like border
radius, highlighted out these days right here. I realize it's really
hard to see in the screen right now, but I actually have a background
image for those days to make it look a little bit different.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 366. calendar with style, #2 (194) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image366.webp"
  alt="Calendar with Style, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The other thing I've added is that on days that have these little
asterisks, if I click on them, the actual appointment shows up. As you
can see, I'm going to be dealing with a lot of different CSS elements.
And I'm going to slowly go through the code just to give you an idea of
what's going on.</p>
<p>Now it would be impossible for you to follow along with me with this
code and know exactly what I'm doing. Instead, I'm giving it to you as a
resource to kind of pick through and understand the different parts as
you need to and as you want to incorporate them into your page.</p>

  alt="Calendar with Style, #3."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's take a look at the CSS. You can see this is a very, very busy
page. So just kind of sit back and you can hear me talk about the
different things instead of trying to read the code. I've gone in and I
wanted to make my calendar with a very nice border radius so I'd have
something around the top. The thing is, the table itself is really only
this part. It's not the caption.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 368. calendar with style, #4 (195) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image368.webp"
  alt="Calendar with Style, #4."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What I've done is I said, don't worry about the top two corners, here
and here. Only curve the bottom two corners, all right. How do I get
this cool idea of alternating between a kind of light gray and this
color and going back and forth? Well with this, you can use some of the
different pseudo elements. In this case I've gone in. And it's not me.
It's the browser saying, hey, I'm going to look at all the different
table rows. And any time I see a child that's odd, I'm going to make it
one color, any time I see a child that's even, I'm going to make it
another color. This is so much nicer than you having to go into your
table and putting class equals even, class equals odd, class equals
even, especially if later you decide to add more information and it
throws off your rows. This is something really powerful that you should
try to take advantage of.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 369. calendar with style, #5 (196) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image369.webp"
  alt="Calendar with Style, #5."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What about when you try to make your page look really professional,
the elements that overlap? Right here, I'm actually looking at a table,
and a table row, and a table element. I had to go through and think
about each one of these and think about things like, hm, well in my very
last table row, the very last table element, that's got a different
curve than the first child.</p>
<p>Go ahead, download this code and take a look at that and play with
it. What happens if you comment it out? What's going to go on? All
right, I have fairly simple code for the caption, I went ahead and just
added some border radius and colors. What I really want to show you is
this whole idea of when you want to hide things.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 370. calendar with style, #6 (196) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image370.webp"
  alt="Calendar with Style, #6."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's go back to the HTML. I have put all of my elements Inside a
span tag. So here, I've got span library helper. I'm hoping that you are
thinking right now and going, why don't these show up when I first look
at the calendar? Why isn't it there?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 371. calendar with reminder hidden (197) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image371.webp"
  alt="Calendar with Reminder Hidden."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Well, the reason would be because by default, I'm going to hide all
of the different appointments. I'm going to say, visibility hidden. Now
this is different than display none. If I had display none, this whole
square would just be gone, it wouldn't be there. Visibility hidden says,
I want to leave all that space, but I don't want to show what's in
there. It's a very little nuanced thing, and this is exactly why I made
this example, so you could see the difference. All right, so now it's
hidden.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 372. calendar with reminder by date (197) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image372.webp"
  alt="Calender with Reminder by Date."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>But as soon as I make it active, and active means as soon as you're
clicking on it, I change the visibility from hidden to visible. Let's
click on it. And you can see that lunch with mom show up. Library
helper, and also here, on Halloween, I've got a little message
there.</p>
<p>There was a lot going on with this CSS. And I don't want to go down
every line of it, and you don't want me to do that either. It'd be very
boring. I'm hoping though, that I've shown you some of the ways that
these pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, the different states, are all go
together to create a page that can look so much better than just plain
HTML by itself. So, I'm hoping you'll use this code and create something
great for yourself. Good luck.</p>

<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image373.webp"
  alt="4.02. Creating Navigation Menus."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Welcome back. Since it's week four and you're working on your final
project, what I want to do is show you some of the different options
that you can use when you're styling your pages. And in this module, I
want to show you what happens when you try to make a vertical navigation
bar.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 374. playing with vertical nav bars (198) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image374.webp"
  alt="Playing with Vertical Navigation Bars."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>So over here in my browser, I have what the page is going to look
like when we're done. But let's go ahead and I'll hit refresh and first
see what it would look like if I tried to make a navigation bar using
four simple links.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 375. add style to links (199) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image375.webp"
  alt="Adding style to links in nav bar."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Again, links are inline, so they go next to each other. There's no
color. There's nothing going on. And it's really horrible. So let me put
that style back in. Refresh the page. And I’m going to show you how I
created this navigation bar.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 376. nav: box-sizing: border-box (199) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image376.webp"
  alt="Change nav to box-sizing: border-box."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let’s start by talking about the body. I just put in some background
color, padding, and margin. That’s not really important here. What’s
important is talking about our navigation section.</p>
<p>One of the things I wanted to do is to show you the idea of using
that box-sizing border-box. What this is going to do is it takes away
the need for you to count up how much width, how much padding, how much
border. You don't have to do the math. The browser will do it for you. I
put in some simple border, color, background color, etc.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 377. inline-block nav (200) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image377.webp"
  alt="Make navigation inline-bock."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The first thing I did, though, is I made it inline-block, because I
want my navigation to be next to the other parts of my page. And since
nav is block, it won't happen unless I throw it in there. So, I said I
wanted it to be about 20% of the page and then added some margin.</p>
<p>Now, something new you may not have seen before is this idea of
height equals 100vh. That's your viewport height. This means I want the
navigation to take up the whole height of your page. I'm not
hard-coating it to 400 pixels or 200 pixels, because I don't know how
big the screen is that you're looking at.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 378. navigation height and length (200) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image378.webp"
  alt="Navigation height and length."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Next, let's talk about the actual lengths themselves. What I've gone
in and done is I've taken away the regular boring links and I've really
styled them to make them something a little more original. I put in a
height of how high I want each one of my links to be. And then I put in
a little bit of a trick and I said I want the line height to be 45
pixels. Why would I do that? The reason would be I want to center home
photos or I want to center the words within it and this is how I can do
it.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 379. add background-image (201) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image379.webp"
  alt="Add background-image."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The next kind of cool thing I've done is I've added a background
image. I added these little arrows. And the cool thing that I had to do
that I want to really point out to you is I couldn't just link to the
folder and then the file. Because of the way I set up my code, first I
need to say, oh, I know I'm in the CSS folder right now, so I'm going to
go back up to my main folder and then find images. If this is confusing
for you, don't worry. It's a brand-new concept, but it's something that
a lot of you are going to run into as you try to link images from your
style sheet. All right.</p>
<p>The last thing I did was just add in a little padding, so there's
room for the picture, and then add some margin. Using these different
things, we've already talked about, display, line height, background
URLs, we were able to make something that I think looks really cool for
a simple, vertical navigation bar. Go ahead and try it. Good luck.</p>

<h2 id="week4-03">4.03. Accessible Navigation</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 380. accessible navigation (4.03) (202) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image380.webp"
  alt="4.03. Accessible Navigation."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>In this lecture we're going to be talking about accessible
navigation. I know that this course is mostly about CSS, but I always
like to pop in and remind you of the different things you need to think
about as you're styling your pages. Navigation is really the most
critical aspect of accessibility. If people can't navigate through your
page and get to the content they really need to get to, then you've
really just wasted their time and some of yours.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 381. navigation, #1 (202) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image381.webp"
  alt="Navigation, #1."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>So, sighted users have these kind of tried and true things that they
look for on a page. They know what a search box is. They know where the
banner usually goes. Where the main navigation is. And it’s not
surprising to them that often the main content, in what we call the
content well, is hidden down lower in a page. And we know this because
we can see it just as soon as we open up the browser.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 382. navigation, #2 (203) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image382.webp"
  alt="Navigation, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>But for blind or low vision-users, they really need to rely on proper
coding of the page in order to get to what they want to get to. And not
just the proper coding, but there are a lot of stylistic issues you need
to think about when you're doing this.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 383. what if you can't see? (203) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image383.webp"
  alt="What If You Can't See?"
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What if you can't see? The first place that you get information is
from the title of the page. You want to make sure that your title is
short but also lets the user know how this page is different from other
pages at your site.</p>
<p>Next, the proper heading placement, and kind of this hierarchy,
allows screen users to skip the different navigational links and get
directly to what they're looking for. I think you've all been to sites
where it feels like you need to go to one place and then you follow
another and you follow another. And this can be really annoying and
irritating. Especially so if it's really important that your mouse is on
just the right spot. We want to make sure that we let screen readers and
other users skip right to where they want to go.</p>
<p>We also want to think about your links. Because when you have the
links to the different sites in your page, those descriptions are all
that people have going for them. So, you don't want to use Click Me,
Follow Me Here. You want to give good information in those link
descriptions.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 384. proper heading hierarchy, #1 (204) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image384.webp"
  alt="Proper Heading Hierarchy, #1."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Next, we need to talk about proper heading hierarchy, okay? Headings
need to be nested in order to really provide structure, so you shouldn't
have h3 headings before you have h2 headings. You should only have one
h1 heading. You shouldn't jump from h2 to h4. Instead, you really want
to follow a certain kind of order so that people can realize that there
is meaning behind your page.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 385. proper heading hierarchy, #2 (204) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image385.webp"
  alt="Proper Heading Hierarchy, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Here's an example right here. I have my single h1 heading, and then
in this page, I can imagine that I have three sections. Each one of
those sections has an h2 heading inside of it. And in my first section,
it might be that I have these certain little bullet points or other
points I'm making, where they're important enough that I've decided hey,
I'm going to use h3 to signify that this is another subsection within my
section.</p>
<p>Where people get in trouble and what you see all the time, is that
people decide, I really like the look of that h2 font. I like just how
big the text is. I like how the kind of font they use, so I'm just going
to put as many things as I can into the h2 font because I like the way
it looks. And they're not thinking about the semantics. The same thing
happens with the h3 font. You'll go to somebody's page and find out
there are no h2 fonts at all. Instead, it's all h3 elements, and they
only did that because they like the look of that particular tag. So now,
this is where the styling comes in, this is why I'm talking about this
in the styling class. Is that now you know that instead, if you really
like the look of that h3 heading, instead of using the tag, you should
be styling other tags to replicate that look. Find out which font family
they use. Find out which font size. Just repeat it. Don't use tags just
because you like the way they look.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 386. off-page headings, #1 (205) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image386.webp"
  alt="Off-Page Headings, #1."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The other thing you can think about to help navigation, is this idea
of off-page headings. It's useful to do when you want to give the screen
reader user some sort of navigational aid, but you don't want to put it
right in the page and have your sighted users also have to deal with it
all the time.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 387. off-page headings, #2 (206) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image387.webp"
  alt="Off-Page Headings with Example, #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let me give you an example of this one. We're going to use styling
sheets to basically set something offpage, we've given it the name of
offpage, and we've said, hey, I want to place this in a position
absolute off to the left by -1000px. So, you'll know that that's pretty
far off.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 388. u of michigan human resources page (206) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image388.webp"
  alt="University of Michigan Human Resources Page."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>I have here the University of Michigan Human Resources page. And if
you look up near the top, there's really nothing there, up here in the
top corner. But what I'm going to do, is I'm going to go ahead and hit
Tab. And, what Tab does, is it brings the next element into focus.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 389. tab to next element into focus (207) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image389.webp"
  alt="Tab to Next Element into Focus."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Go ahead and Tab, there. And you can see, that now, there's this new
thing here that says Skip to main content.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 390. off-screen navigation links (207) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image390.webp"
  alt="Off-Screen Navigation Links."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>If I click on it, I go all the way down, and I was able to skip a lot
of this additional information that they didn't really need to see. It
was more just marketing and different things like that. So, these
different off screen navigation links are extremely useful to allow
people to jump immediately to what they want to get to. But, by using
styling, we've taken it off the page that you only use it if you really
want to.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 391. off-page headings (208) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image391.webp"
  alt="Off-Page Headings."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>One of the things I wanted to mention is, if you're going to do off-page headings, 
don't use {display: none} or {visibility: hidden}. These really just kind of mess with 
the code and make it very hard for screen readers or other people looking at your code 
to see what's going on.</p>

<p>At the start of the lecture, I mentioned that meaningful link text is very important 
for accessibility because screen readers can find and list all of the links. Now, what 
you may not realize is the way that these links are displayed may not be in the way you 
expect.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 392. meaningful link text (208) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image392.webp"
  alt="Meaningful Link Text."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>They may be out of context. You may only be able to access them via tabbing or they 
may be presented in a list. You really want to avoid using things such as click here, 
read this and more. The reason being, is that maybe the only context some people get in 
order to go to the links.</p>

<p>Also, please don't use the URL as a link description. It's pretty common to go to a 
site and you can see click here, and they have the entire URL, www.umich.edu/etc. It may 
look very descriptive, but if you have to listen to the description, it can be very 
confusing. Instead, unless you have a very short URL, go ahead and use some sort of 
textual description.</p>

<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image393.webp"
  alt="4.03. Review - Accessible Navigation."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Just to review, let's think about what we've learned today. When you finish making 
your page, it's not enough for it to look good. You need to think about how easy it is 
to navigate your page. Think about what would happen if the colors weren't there, or 
if somebody could only navigate to your page with a mouse.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 394. old web page with style (209) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"

  alt="Old Web Page with Styling."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>I want to show you really quickly what I'm talking about here. Here's an old page of 
mine, and, at the bottom, I have the University of Michigan. I just want to show you 
what happens when I take away the style.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 395. old web page without style (210) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image395.webp"
  alt="Old Web Page without Styling."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The page now, you can't even see the text anymore. These are the kind of small 
things that you would never notice unless you checked your page both with and without 
styling.</p>

<p>When you plan your page, make sure you're planning for everyone. Make great use of 
headings. Make great use of link text. And make sure that you're giving people the tools 
they need to navigate your page successfully. Thanks.</p>

<h2>A Change to the Accessibility of Headings</h2>

<p>It used to be that the general rule was one &lt;h1&gt; heading per page. However, 
with the advent of HTML5 and its many container elements (aside, section, article, etc.) 
this rule has changed. 
<a href="href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/the-truth-about-multiple-h1-tags-in-the-html5-era--webdesign-16824" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
Here</a> is a link to an interesting article that explains why multiple &lt;h1&gt; 
headings will probably improve the accessibility <em><b>and</b></em> search engine 
optimization of your page.</p>

<p>But just to be difficult, I will include <a href="https://yoast.com/headings-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> link to someone who disagrees.</p>

<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image396.webp"
  alt="Creating Navigation Menus #2."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Welcome back to another code review. Earlier, I created a navigation
bar that worked vertically. It went up and down. Today, I just want to
show you how you can use the same HTML code but create a horizontal
navigation bar, instead.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 397. styling navigation menu (211) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image397.webp"
  alt="Styling Navigation Menu."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's take a look. I want to go to something that looks a little bit
more like this. And, not only have I gone to a horizontal navigation
bar, I want to show you an example of showing which page is the one
we're currently looking at. So, if you notice, in the navigation bar,
the photos link looks a little bit different from the others. It's very
common to do this to kind of indicate to people this is the page that
you're looking at right now.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 398. style links inside nav bar (212) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image398.webp"
  alt="Style Links in nav Bar."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's take a look at the CSS and see how I've taken plain HTML and
turned it into something where I have a nicely styled navigation bar.
All right, we start off by saying, you know what? We want to style all
the links that are in the navigation bar. I don't want to style all the
links, instead, I want to indicate just the links that are inside nav.
And once we do that, it was fairly simple for me to go ahead and put in
that I want a certain height, a certain background color, a certain text
decoration. One of the things I added here is a border radius. Border
radius curves the boxes, so if you look, everything's a little bit
curved over here along the side. Nothing too important right there.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 399. add class: current (212) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image399.webp"
  alt="Add class current."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The next thing I have, the new one, is this idea of having a class
called current. What the current class does, is it basically is a way of
tagging. Hey, you know all the different links that are on my page? I
want to show you which one I'm looking at right now. And all I did here
was set it so that I have a different background color. It was fairly
straightforward to create this horizontal navigation bar as long as
you're very careful about spacing things out.</p>
<p>I want to show you that things like padding and margin are very
important and they're very additive. When you use percents, instead of
pixels, it's going to keep it from being that it looks fine on a big
screen and then bad on a small screen.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 400. add hover state to nav links (213) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image400.webp"
  alt="Add Hover State to Navigation Links."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The last thing, I put in here just to have some fun and to help show
you again some of the different things you can do with CSS, is I added a
hover state for any of my navigation links. If you take a look, I've
gone in here and I've said when somebody hovers over the page, I want to
change the color of the text and I want to get rid of that whole border
radius thing. Let's take a look. Go over here, I'm going to hover over
recipes and the text is turned from white to black, and it's gone from
circle to square.</p>
<p>As I go over all these different examples with you, it's really
important that you realize, I am not an artist, and I am not very
artistic. And I'm hoping that you can take these snippets of code and
turn it into something that looks really great and customized for the
page that you are trying to create. So go ahead, have some fun, and now
try to make a navigation bar that goes in all different ways, up and
down, sideways, or even combinations. Good luck.</p>

<p>Guess what? We're going to do another, and our final, navigation bar
together, in this code review. This one, though, is a little bit
different, not only for the way we set things up, but because I want to
talk to you about the accessibility of how many people make their
navigation bars. The new way, I've used this way, is to create your
navigation links as part of lists.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 402. unordered list with 4 items (214) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image402.webp"
  alt="Unordered List with 4 List Items."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>You can see, we already have it a little bit different over here.
I've got an unordered list with one, two, three, four a list items, and
some of those list items have unordered lists themselves. While this is
very common, there are some usability issues, when you realize, are
these really lists? Because if not, that's a semantic tag we're using,
that we may want to avoid. But it's so common, I want to show it to you
and let you play with it and make your own decisions.</p>
<p>The other issue when we make this drop-down navigation bar, has to do
with the accessibility of people being able to hover over certain things
that you want to activate. I think we've all been there, when we've been
in a webpage and we're trying to hover over something to click a link.
And it keeps popping away because our hand is too shaky or we have to
hover over three things at the same time.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 403. playing with dropdown nav bars (215) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image403.webp"
  alt="Playing with Dropdown Navigation Bars."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Again, while this is a technique, I want to share with you and help
you to understand, I hope that you'll make sure that any applications
you do, you do your best to make sure it's as accessible as
possible.</p>
<p>Again, let's start with this plain, kind of boring HTML code, and see
if we can't get it to look like something a little bit more
exciting.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 404. horizontal nav bar (215) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image404.webp"
  alt="Horizontal Navigation Bar."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What we have here now is a horizontal navigation bar that's going to
have drop down elements.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 405. on hover, dropdown nav bar (216) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image405.webp"
  alt="On Hover, Dropdown Navigation Bar."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When I go over Home, there's nothing extra to see, but, when I go over Pictures, you 
can see that I have three additional links I can try to do, and same with Recipes, and 
Contact, again, is all by itself. How did I do this? How did I have it so that 2015, 14, 
and 13 don't show up unless I'm hovering? And the same with the recipes?</p>

<p>Let's take a look. All right, I'm going to skip the body in the navigation because I 
think you know how to do all this. Instead, let's talk about the different lists 
themselves. So sorry, list items themselves in the links.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 406. style for hover, dropdown nav bar (216) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image406.webp"
  alt="Styles for Hover, Dropdown Navigation Bar."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What I've done is I've gone in here, kind of so you can see both at the same time. 
And it's very faint, and I wish I had made a different color now. But I have a border 
between each one of these options. Now, it would have looked a little bit weird for me 
to have a border right here along the side.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 407. remove border on nav bar (217) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image407.webp"
  alt="Remove Border on Last Menu Option of Navigation Bar."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>What I needed to do is I went and I said you know what? For that last list item, the 
very last one, let's not put a border in. It's that little tiny tweaks that you can put 
in your code to make it look a little bit more professional. We also don't want borders 
on the sub items, right? Because there's nothing. Since those are blocked, we don't
need borders on the side.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 408. remove last border on last sub-menu nav bar (217) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image408.webp"
  alt="Remove Last Border on Last Sub-Menu Navigation Bar."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>I did the same thing over here, where I said, you know what? I don't want to use any 
borders over here. Pretty straight forward, I hope. Now, let's look again. I did simple 
styling on my navigation links, all right?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 409. color transition example (218) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image409.webp"
  alt="Color Transition Example."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>The one thing I did put in is, again, I wanted to show you an example of using 
transition. The transition here is what slowly changes the color when you hover over, 
rather than a quick change. So, you can see, it's a little bit more gradual than sudden, 
all right? The active is just like last time.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 410. sub-menu (218) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image410.webp"
  alt="Sub-menus."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Now, here's the interesting part. We're going to talk about the sub menus, all right? 
So how does the browser know when something's a sub menu? Well, it can look at the DOM, 
and it can look down and go, oh, I'm in navigation. And now I'm in an unordered list, 
and here I am in a list item. If it finds another list item lower down, it's kind of 
chaining down, it knows, oh, oh, I'm in a sub menu. So right here, it knows I'm in the 
nav, I'm inside of a list, and I just found an unordered list inside of there.</p>
<p>How we have it set up so that it doesn't show at the beginning is that I've set the 
position to absolute, and I've set the display to none. It's not going to show up by 
default. Not going to happen. Okay? How do I get it so that it suddenly does show up if 
we want to do something along that line?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 411. nav li hover display block (219) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image411.webp"
  alt="Nav line item (li) hover display block."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Well, we want to find out how to change it here, when I hover over a list item that 
has an unordered list underneath it, change that display from none to block. This command
display: block; sets it up. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 412. hover, display block - nav bars (219) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image412.webp"
  alt="Nav Bars - Hover, display block."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When I go over to my menu, by default, display is none, but when I hover, display 
becomes block. It's a very simple, short code, very powerful concept to understand.</p>
<p>I've shown you a few different ways that you can style your navigation bars. We have 
horizontal, we have vertical, we have drop down. I really hope that you'll pick one that 
you feel the most comfortable with, or actually really, the most excited about, and create
one for your final project here in this CSS class. Don't worry if you run into problems. 
Post to the discussion board. Go online and look up answers. But what I really hope is 
that you can create something that you're proud of, that is both beautiful and accessible. 
Good luck.</p>

<h2>Final Project Description</h2>

<p>This homework is also described in a module lecture (4-06 below). Make sure to read 
it to get a better feel for what I am looking for.</p>

<h3>Objectives:</h3>

<ol type="1">
  <li>Create a style sheet and link it to the html files. (Without changing the html.)</li>
  <li>Style the sheet using the properties we covered in lecture. There is a particular 
    emphasis on pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes. There is an opportunity to use some 
	properties we didn’t cover in class. For instance, we want to style on the first 
	element of each row to be left-aligned. The rest should be centered.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Background:</h3>

<p>I assume that you have finished all of the Week Three lecture videos, and you 
may want to watch Week Four as you complete this assignment. This assignment builds 
on Assignments One and Two. Our final step is to style the table on the team’s page.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.intro-webdesign.com/CSS/final/teams.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is a link to the team’s page after the final project.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 413. menu, after final project (220) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image413.webp"
  alt="Menu, After - Ultimate Frisbee Teams."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Here (above) is an image of the team’s page after the final project.</p>

<h3>Getting started:</h3>

<p>You will use the same code as you used for Assignment Two. I would recommend 
that you save copy of your style sheet for backup. The html is all still the same.</p>

<h3>Steps:</h3>

<ol type="1">
  <li>Style the following:
    <ul>
      <li>The table should be styled using at least four properties,</li>
      <li>The table headings should have a thicker bottom border with the
	    top two corners rounded, a background color, and at least one other
		property,</li>
	  <li>Style the table so that the text in the first column is left-aligned 
	    and the text in the other two columns is centered,</li>
	  <li>Set the opacity of the table rows to a value between .6 and .8 (make 
	    sure it is still visible),</li>
	  <li>Change the opacity of a row when it is hovered over, and</li>
	  <li>The table elements &lt;td&gt; should be styled using at least four 
	    properties.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Welcome back. It's time for us to start our final project. I'm hoping by the time 
you're done with this; you're going to have something that you feel really proud of and 
that you'll want to share.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 415. objective (223) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image415.webp"
  alt="Objective: 1 style sheet with 3 different html's."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Again, our objective is that we're going to write one style sheet and style three 
different HTML files.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 416. getting started (223) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image416.webp"
  alt="Getting Started."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Now, when you get started, I'm going to assume that you have the second peer-graded 
assignment done. You can feel free to alter that as much as you want, but I need to know 
that those changes are completed.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

  alt="After menu as index, teams, and history in JPG image."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>All right, so let me show you our before's and our after's for where we're going 
with this final project.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 419/420. ultimate frisbee before/after (224) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image419.webp"
  alt="Ultimate Frisbee menu, before."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image420.webp"
  alt="Ultimate Frisbee menu, after."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>Let's look at what we've done so far in this course. We had our first HTML view. 
Our next one, we made it really plain.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 421/422. watch your head, #1 & #2 (224) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border"
  src="./images/image422.webp"
  alt="Watch Your Head, #1."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<img class="border"
  src="./images/image422.webp"
  alt="Watch Your Head, #2."
  style="width:40%; float: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 1em;" />
<p style="clear: both;"></p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 423. teams page styling (224) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image423.webp"
  alt="Teams Page Styling."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Our third one, where we added in some different style. And finally,
on our fourth one, it might not look very different on this first page,
but where I'm really going to have you focus is on the Teams page, and
on this table.</p>
<p>You'll be able to see that I have really gone out and put a lot of
styling into this table. And the reason I picked tables is because this
will be a chance for us to go in and use those pseudo classes. Use those
pseudo elements, use some gradients, all those little things that can be
a little bit difficult to achieve, but once you've got it done, it looks
really good.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 424. you must leave the html alone (225) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image424.webp"
  alt="You Must Leave the HTML Alone."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's talk about each one of these little parts. Once again, just a reminder, make a 
single style sheet. I don't want a different style sheet for each page, you want one 
that's going to cover everybody. And we're going to be using pseudo-elements and 
pseudo-classes. If you seem a little bit confused about that, don't forget, we've got 
slides that cover this as well as some of our code together examples.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 425. table (225) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image425.webp"
  alt="Table."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Let's start with the table because that's the bulk of the page. At the very minimum, 
I want you to style the font, the width, and the margin. Now when you style the font, 
there are a lot of different options you can look at. You can have different font 
families. You can change the size, the weight, and the line height.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I recommend line height, is that when you do that, it's much 
easier to center the text within the rows if you've made the line height the same as 
the text size. For your width, I don't want your table to take up the whole page. I
want it to take up somewhere between 75 and 90%. And one of the reasons I want you to 
do that, is because I want you to center the table. I want you to play with that margin 
property. And figure out how you can take up just the right amount of space and put it 
right where you want it.</p>

<p>Next, we're going to look at the table heading. The table heading looks a little bit 
different from the other rows, and it has that important semantic meaning. So, by using 
the table heading tags, we're going to be able to kind of double up on this idea that 
we're styling it differently and it means something different.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 426. th (table heading) (226) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image426.webp"
  alt="th - Table Heading."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>First, change the background color. Once you get that to work, I want you to try 
putting in a gradient background color. Now don't forget in order to use gradient, 
you're going to need to put in some browser prefixes.</p>
<p>Next, add a border but I only want you to round the top two corners, not the whole 
thing, and then also make the bottom border thicker. Finally, when you're done with 
this, go ahead and add just at least one other property, something that you think 
would look cool.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 427. tr (table row) (226) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image427.webp"
  alt="tr - Table Row."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Once you have the table heading done, let's go ahead and put in some
styling for the table rows. The first thing I want you to do, and
there's a reason for this, is I want you to set the opacity of the table
rows to some value of about 0.8. Somewhere around there. Where you can
still read the text, but it's a little bit faded out.</p>
<p>Next, I want you to make sure that the first column of every table
row is left-aligned and the other two are centered. Now, you may do this
styling within your table row elements, or you may be doing it within
the table elements, those TDs. It really depends upon how you jump in
and try to style this.</p>
<p>Finally, I want you to go ahead and put in another pseudo-class.
Where when someone hovers over any of the rows, it's going to change
from a kind of faded out to a darker color. And I'm going to show you an
example of that before I go on.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 429. opacity (227) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image429.webp"
  alt="Opacity example."
  style="width:50%" />

<p>If you notice in this table, the text is a little bit faded out from
being solid black font color. That's where the opacity comes in.</p>
<p>Now, when I hover over each team name, you'll see that the font gets
a little bit darker. I didn't change the font color here, I didn't
change the font family, or the type, or anything like that. Instead,
what I changed is the opacity, set to 1.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 430. td (table data) (227) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image430.webp"
  alt="td - Table Data."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>When my hover goes off, it goes back to that original kind of faded
out value. Each of the table elements can take any amount of styling
that you want to give it. But what I do want to see you do is I want to
see you style the padding, the font color and background color. And I
want you to set the border radius to two pixels. You would never be able
to see that kind of indistinguishable or subtle difference on the table.
I want you to put it in, just so when I tell you to do it, you notice
that there is an actual change there.</p>

<p>Finally, this would be a great chance for you to do something that I
haven't covered myself. Part of being a web designer is learning to go
out there and search for different properties that you can play with. I
would encourage you to go out and look at text-shadow. It's something I
use in my example. If you really want to try to replicate it, go ahead
and try to use it yourself.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 431. peer grading (228) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image431.webp"
  alt="Peer Grading."
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Once again, we'll be using peer grading for this assignment. And
grades will be based on both level of completion and some level of
aesthetics. Proper coding standards are always going to apply, but you
can specify your preferred screen size. If somebody decides to take your
CSS and apply it to the HTML, you can let them know this really looks
best on a large screen or small mobile device.</p>
<p>Now, there are actually many, many ways that you could change this
style sheet around. And so, I don't want you worrying about hitting off
every single standard. But if you do decide to do something a little
crazy, a little different, and something that other people might not
understand. I recommend that you put that near the bottom of your style
sheet. So that people looking at your code can focus on the actual
requirements and then afterwards be amazed at your really cool
innovations. I'm hoping that this is something that will help solidify
your understanding of CSS. If you run into problems, you should feel
free to use the discussion boards and ask people anything that you're
not quite sure on. Or just share something cool that you got to work.
Good luck.</p>

  style="width:40%" />

<p>I am so happy to say congratulations, that you've made it this far in
the class, and that you've hopefully completed the final project. We
have all come a really long way from the plain pages that we began with
to something that's really styled. I hope you've learned a little bit of
theory and a little bit of practice, and you're putting it together to
create something really unique.</p>
<p>At this point, you might be wondering, what next? I've gone to the
HTML class maybe, and I've definitely just finished the CSS class. What
can I do to continue my own progress as a web designer?</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 433. what next? (229) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<img class="border displayed"
  src="./images/image433.webp"
  alt="What Next?"
  style="width:40%" />

<p>Well first, I would really encourage you to consider creating your
own site from scratch. Draw it out, style it, do all the little things
that you wanted to do, but you didn't because you were too busy doing
the assignments.</p>
<p>Once you've done that, you can continue to practice your skills. One
of the things people often ask me is, I want to get a job as a web
designer. What should I do? Well, when you go and you talk to other
people about web design, they're going to want to know, what are you
working on right now? Whether it may be just working on transitions,
transforms, accessibility, you should always have something that you're
thinking about your site to work on right now.</p>
<p>You're also probably at this point ready to join a Meet Up or
different workshops. You're not at web developer status yet. You're not
really close because you need more practice. You need more experience.
But what you can do is, you know enough that you can meet up with other
web designers and talk to them about what they're doing. It's a great
way to find out what's happening right now and to make connections,
because connections are so important.</p>
<p>There's also a group called Girls Develop. It’s nationwide, and they
often hold workshops. You are definitely ready to volunteer to be a TA
and work with others as they build their own HTML and CSS skills. Also,
if you're really interested in continuing your knowledge, you're going
to want to learn about using JavaScript to add some interactivity to
your site.</p>
<p>The last thing you may want to think about is learning more about
what's called responsive design. Responsive design will use the CSS that
you've been learning all this time and tailor it to the different
viewports. You might want your page to look different on a mobile
platform versus a laptop versus a tablet. Responsive design does more
than just show you, hey, you can make things small or bigger. You think
about what really belongs on the page to best make your page accessible
to others.</p>
<p>So again, congratulations and thank you for helping each other out on
the discussion boards and in other ways as you all created something
great in CSS 3.</p>
